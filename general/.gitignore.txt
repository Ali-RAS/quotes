First principle: one must need strength, otherwise one will never have it.
Who is strong? He that can conquer his bad habits.
He that can compose himself, is wiser than he that composes books.
In matters of style, swim with the current; in matters of principle, stand like a rock.
Never give up on what you really want to do. The person with big dreams is more powerful than one with all the facts.
Just like in bodybuilding, failure is also a necessary experience for growth in our own lives, for if we’re never tested to our limits, how will we know how strong we really are? How will we ever grow?
It takes more strength to repair than to build, to start anew than to begin, to be reconciled than to get along.

Be more than motivated, be more than driven, become literally obsessed to the point where people think you’re f*cking nuts. David Goggins
This life is all a f*cking mind game. Realize that. Own it!
You must be courageous to admit that all things are possible, and that you are equipped to handle them all.
Courage is more exhilarating than fear and in the long run it is easier. We do not have to become heroes overnight. Just a step at a time, meeting each thing that comes up, seeing it is not as dreadful as it appeared, discovering we have the strength to stare it down.
You are only free when you realize you belong no place – you belong every place – no place at all. The price is high. The reward is great.
The most spiritual men, as the strongest, find their happiness where others would find their destruction: in the labyrinth, in hardness against themselves and others, in experiments. Their joy is self-conquest: asceticism becomes in them nature, need, and instinct. Difficult tasks are a privilege to them; to play with burdens that crush others, a recreation. Knowledge – a form of asceticism. They are the most venerable kind of man: that does not preclude their being the most cheerful and the kindliest.
All the happiness in the world, all the good fortune on earth, compares not to a mind that has come upon silence.
You’re braver than you believe, and stronger than you seem, and smarter than you think.
What makes you beautiful is your presence. What makes you wise is your perseverance.

Life is hard and unfair. That’s why you must get up one more time. That’s why you must keep going no matter what.
While it’s admirable to have a strong personality that’s consistent for all, one who can’t adjust to the moment is at a serious disadvantage.
Meeting smaller emergencies and learning to deal with them had given me the confidence to deal with this larger emergency. So, little by little, I found out how to do things. After each catastrophe you don’t worry so much the next time, and each time you emerge stronger from your victory.
How to develop old school mental toughness: 1. Resist impulses 2. Get uncomfortable 3. Workout 4. Eat healthy 5. Sleep 6. Set goals 7. Get organized 8. Meditate 9. Manage time 10. Live in gratitude 11. Relentless determination.
Take the long view. This is going to be a nine-inning game. There will be highs and lows. Focus on what you can control.

The world caters to the unserious. The serious must cater to themselves.
The world is too big and too busy to care about you. This is a blessing, for it makes you free.
If you are easily provoked you are easily controlled.
I say, drop all your defences. Anyone can make a mistake — even you. Do not defend your mistakes; just accept them and move on. When you are totally defenceless, that is when you will be completely strong.

It’s impossible to improve yourself when you see yourself as a victim in every situation.
There is nobody who is going to solve any of our problems, either political, religious or psychological.

If we are not ashamed to think it, we should not be ashamed to say it.
Your good fortune is not to need good fortune. (On Providence)
Anything which is troubling you, anything which is irritating you, that is your teacher.
It is preposterous to take to heart that which you should throw over your shoulders.
Buddha’s doctrine: man suffers because of his craving to possess and keep forever things which are impermanent.
You aren’t mature enough to debate something if you can’t accept the possibility of being wrong.
The weak focus on appearing strong and smart. The wise ignore others and find solutions.
How unlucky I am that this should happen to me. But not at all. Perhaps, say how lucky I am that I am not broken by what has happened, and I am not afraid of what is about to happen.
Nature builds things that are antifragile. In the case of evolution, nature uses disorder to grow stronger. Occasional starvation or going to the gym also makes you stronger, because you subject your body to stressors and gain from them.
We must gain victory, not by assaulting the walls, but by accepting them. Only when this surrender is made can we assure ourselves of inward quietness, and locate the next step on the road to ultimate victory.
Whoever then wishes to be free, let him neither wish for anything nor avoid anything which depends on others: if he does not observe this rule, he must be a slave.
But what is philosophy? Doesn’t it simply mean preparing ourselves for what may come? Don’t you understand that really amounts to saying that if I would so prepare myself to endure, then let anything happen that will? Otherwise, it would be like the boxer exiting the ring because he took some punches. Actually, you can leave the boxing ring without consequence, but what advantage would come from abandoning the pursuit of wisdom? So, what should each of us say to every trial we face? This is what I’ve trained for, for this my discipline!
Amateurs believe that the world should work the way they want it to. Professionals realize that they have to work with the world as they find it.
When you see yourself as a witness, separate from ego, then no person or situation can shake you.
Failure-resistant is achievable; failure-free is not.
Do not let the body be dragged along by mind nor be dragged along by the body.
Do what you can, with what you have, where you are.
No one can make you feel inferior without your consent.
When I was a boy I used to think that strong meant having big muscles, great physical power; but the longer I live, the more I realize that real strength has much more to do with what is not seen. Real strength has to do with helping others.
Why fit in when you were born to stand out?
I wonder if we confuse strength and other words – like aggression and even violence. Real strength is neither male nor female; but is, quite simply, one of the finest characteristics that any human being can possess.
Life is a blend of sensitivity and sensibility. Sensibility is intellect, sensitivity is of the heart. You need to be sensitive yet strong.
Conquer yourself rather than the world.
When you over value compliments you become vulnerable to insults and judgement.
When one has not had a good father, one must create one.
Think of the life you have lived until now as over and, as a dead man, see what’s left as a bonus and live it according to Nature. Love the hand that fate deals you and play it as your own, for what could be more fitting?
I’ve decided to make myself strong. As far as I can tell, that’s all I can do.
No matter what they say, no matter what they think, do the right thing.
People are capable, at any time in their lives, of doing what they dream of.
You must do the thing you think you cannot do.
Fire is the test of gold; adversity, of strong men.
The art of life is not controlling what happens to us, but using what happens to us.
Don’t go to the doctor with every distemper, nor to the lawyer with every quarrel, nor to the pot for every thirst.
All that happens to us, including our humiliations, our misfortunes, our embarrassments, all is given to us as raw material, as clay, so that we may shape our art.
So other people hurt me? That’s their problem. Their character and actions are not mine.
Either you reach a higher point today, or you exercise your strength in order to be able to climb higher tomorrow.
To try to avoid pain is to give too many f*cks about pain. In contrast, if you’re able to not give a f*ck about pain, you become unstoppable.
Comfort is the craving that can take away your life. Develop the power to resist it, and you become unstoppable.
Mankind has never achieved greatness but through suffering.
There is no security for those who seek it outside of themselves.

Be persevering at the bottom, humble at the top.
We can do anything we want to do if we stick to it long enough.
Success comes from curiosity, concentration, perseverance and self-criticism.
There is no armor like perseverance.
Perseverance is the hard work you do after you get tired of doing the hard work you already did.
He who has a why to live can bear with almost any how.
There’s no talent here. This is hard work. This is obsession. Talent does not exist.
If it’s endurable, then endure it. Stop complaining.
The extent of the struggle determines the extent of the growth. The obstacle is an advantage, not adversity. The enemy is any perception that prevents us from seeing this.
The less pain we tolerate, the more average we become.
Impatience with actions, patience with results.
The world makes way for the man who knows where he is going.
The further the reward from the effort, the thinner the competition. Patience is the gatekeeper.
Never stop just because you feel defeated. The journey to the other side is attainable only after great suffering.
The people who stick with things for years and never stop almost always win the race.

Three tips for becoming successful: consistency, consistency, and consistency.
The most important thing is to keep going. The second most important thing is to choose the right direction.
You may encounter many defeats, but you must not be defeated. In fact, it may be necessary to encounter the defeats, so you can know who you are, what you can rise from, how you can still come out of it.
Nothing in this world can take the place of persistence. Talent will not; nothing is more common than unsuccessful men with talent. Genius will not; unrewarded genius is almost a proverb. Education will not; the world is full of educated derelicts. Persistence and determination alone are omnipotent. The slogan Press On! has solved and always will solve the problems of the human race.
Progress means getting nearer to the place you want to be. And if you have taken a wrong turn, then to go forward does not get you any nearer.
I was taught the way of progress is neither swift nor easy.
There is no downside to endurance. If you can endure more, you can do more.
Character consists of what you do on the third and fourth tries.
You have to practice even, maybe especially, when it hurts.

Let me tell you the secret that has led to my goal. My strength lies solely in my tenacity.
In the realm of ideas everything depends on enthusiasm… in the real world all rests on perseverance.
You don’t need to build confidence to achieve challenging goals. You build confidence through achieving challenging goals. Confidence is more the result of progress than the cause of it.
Amateurs give up at the first sign of trouble and assume they’re failures. Professionals see failure as part of the path to growth and mastery.
Perhaps happiness is always to be found in the journey uphill, and not in the fleeting sense of satisfaction awaiting at the next peak.
If you can just maintain that consistent energy in one direction, it’s incredible what you could deflect over a long period of time.
Great ones are willing to get burned time and again as they sharpen their swords in the fire.
One of the most astonishing human traits: our ability to keeping getting up, lugging ourselves around and doing our stuff day after day.
Your 1st blog post will be bad, but your 1000th will be great. Your 1st workout will be weak, but your 1000th will be strong. Your 1st meditation will be scattered, but your 1000th will be focused. Put in your reps.
Whoever says you can’t develop mental toughness or anything else doesn’t truly understand the human mind or the human spirit.
Have a sense of urgency and commitment – what you do you must do well, with all of your energy, not with a mind shooting off in a hundred direction.
Man matures when he no longer believes discomfort is uncomfortable.
Through perseverance many people win success out of what seemed destined to be certain failure.
Ask, ‘Why is this so unbearable? Why can’t I endure it?’ You’ll be embarrassed to answer.
If there is no struggle, there is no progress.
Never, never, never, never give up.
Some people want it to happen, some wish it would happen, and others make it happen.
Never give up on what you really want to do. The person with big dreams is more powerful than one with all the facts.
It’s not that I’m so smart, it’s just that I stay with problems longer.
If you dare nothing, then when the day is over, nothing is all you will have gained.
Adversity is always the partner of progress.
I’d rather attempt to do something great and fail than to attempt to do nothing and succeed.

The magnitude of a progress is gauged by the greatness of the sacrifice that it requires.

Perseverance, secret of all triumphs.
Stand firm, and you will win life.
And let us not grow weary of doing good, for in due season we will reap, if we do not give up.
Success seems to be connected with action. Successful men keep moving. They make mistakes, but they don’t quit.
Don’t get upset when people don’t support your dreams, those same folk aren’t supporting their own dreams.
If you really want to be great at something, you have to truly care about it. If you want to be great in a particular area, you have to obsess over it. A lot of people say they want to be great, but they’re not willing to make the sacrifices necessary to achieve greatness. They have other concerns, whether important or not, and they spread themselves out. That’s totally fine. After all, greatness is not for everybody.
One day, the people that didn’t believe in you will tell everyone how they met you.
I did not succeed in life by intelligence. I succeeded because I have a long attention span.
Everybody has a plan until they get punched in the mouth.

The seeds of greatness are planted in the daily grind.
Perseverance is failing 19 times and succeeding the 20th.
There is no substitute for determination, perseverance, and planning.
You are the person you have been waiting for.
The great end of life is not knowledge but action.
It’s not what we do once in a while that shapes our lives. It’s what we do consistently.
You’re a winner if you keep your head up. You’re a warrior if you keep fighting forever.
The secret to genius is not genetics but daily practice married with relentless perseverance.
Let me not pray to be sheltered from dangers, but to be fearless in facing them. Let me not beg for the stilling of my pain, but for the heart to conquer it.
Before you dream about the view from the summit, ask yourself if you’re willing to keep your head down, focus on the path, and spend your life walking up the side of a very big hill. It takes years of walking to earn a minute at the top.
Blessed is the one who perseveres under trial because, having stood the test, that person will receive the crown of life.
We are afflicted in every way, but not crushed; perplexed, but not driven to despair; persecuted, but not forsaken; struck down, but not destroyed.
Show up. Show up when it’s hard. Show up when you’re scared. Just keep showing up. Show them your truth. Do it by showing up and not backing down.
The key to success isn’t studying. The key to success isn’t being rich or coming from a good family or having the right education. The key to success is putting one foot in front of the other, even when you’re scared out of your mind. The key to success is never f*cking giving up.
When you think that you are done, you’re only 40% in to what your body’s capable of doing. That’s just the limits that we put on ourselves.
A savage mindset is a conditioned mindset that knows quitting is not part of the plan. It knows that it has to find a way around any and all obstacles to complete the mission.
Failure is often that early morning hour of darkness which precedes the dawning of the day of success.
A lot of successful people who say “work smart, not hard” worked like dogs to get established.
If you’re willing to bleed a little every day, you may win big later.
You will receive most when you will expect least.
It does not matter how slowly you go as long as you do not stop.
I don’t have talent, so I just get up earlier.
A crowbar is a universal pass key.
Every strike brings me closer to the next home run.
That’s one of the remarkable things about life. It’s never so bad that it can’t get worse.
Even in the mud and scum of things, something always, always sings.
I am extraordinarily patient, provided I get my own way in the end.
I am a slow walker, but I never walk back.
You don’t get to choose not to pay a price, you only get to choose which price you pay.
Once you learn to quit, it becomes a habit.
If you believe talent exists, you’re limiting yourself. If you believe luck exists, you’re lazy. If you believe in yourself, you’re wise.
Superhuman effort…isn’t worth a damn unless it achieves results.
Obstinacy is the result of the will forcing itself into the place of the intellect.
Luck can be created. Build your character until luck becomes your destiny.
Somebody out there thinks you’re an idiot. Somebody out there thinks you’re brilliant. Ignore them both and carry on.
Being a founder is hard. Being an early employee is hard. Being a VC is hard. Being a politician is hard. Being an engineer is hard. Being a writer is hard. Being a friend is hard. Being a partner is hard. Being a parent is hard. It’s all hard. Life is hard, and then you die.
You can’t guarantee your success, but you can guarantee your failure. Don’t give up, and you cannot fail.
When I reach the place of my dreams, I will thank my failures and tears. They too, kept me going.
Routine, repetition, tedium, monotony, ephemeracy, inconsequence, abstraction, disorder, boredom, angst, ennui – these are the true hero’s enemies, and make no mistake, they are fearsome indeed. For they are real.
Perseverance is not a long race; it is many short races one after another.
Everyone wants some magic pill – some life hack – that eliminates the need to do the work. But that does not exist.
You don’t need an easier life, but rather an attitude of perseverance. Attitude precedes outcome.
For water continually dropping will wear hard rocks hollow.
A bend in the road is not the end of the road… Unless you fail to make the turn.
If you don’t know yourself, you don’t know what you love. If you don’t know what you love, you can’t persevere.
It’s hard to prioritize the long term when you think you should feel comfortable in every moment.
Error is inevitable. Persisting in it is not.
Bad persistence: Endlessly doing the same thing with no success. Good persistence: Continuously tweaking your approach until you get results.
Hard lessons are hard to forget. Let hardship be a source of knowledge, not bitterness. Wisdom is hard-won.
The most useful form of patience is persistence. Patience implies waiting for things to improve on their own. Persistence implies keeping your head down and continuing to work when things take longer than you expect.
You might be winning but you’re not growing, and growing might be the most important form of winning.
If you are on the wrong road, progress means doing an about-turn and walking back to the right road; and in that case the man who turns back soonest is the most progressive man.
You don’t control the outcome. You control the quality of effort you put in. That’s what you should hold yourself accountable for.
If you’re focused on the outcome, you’re not focused on the process. Sustain success over long periods comes from a fanatical focus on process. You don’t need to be perfect, just better than yesterday.
Learn to maintain your objectivity, especially when it’s hardest.
We must undergo a hard winter training and not rush into things for which we haven’t prepared.
It is not enough that we do our best; sometimes we must do what is required.
The brick walls are there for a reason. The brick walls are not there to keep us out. The brick walls are there to give us a chance to show how badly we want something. Because the brick walls are there to stop the people who don’t want it badly enough. They’re there to stop the other people.

The pessimist sees difficulty in every opportunity. The optimist sees the opportunity in every difficulty.
Dwell on the beauty of life. Watch the stars, and see yourself running with them.
Negative results are just what I want. They’re just as valuable to me as positive results. I can never find the thing that does the job best until I find the ones that don’t.
Never let your head hang down. Never give up and sit down and grieve. Find another way. And don’t pray when it rains if you don’t pray when the sun shines.
The future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams.
If you don’t like something change it. If you can’t change it, change your attitude about it. Don’t complain.
Believe that life is worth living and your belief will help create the fact.
If opportunity doesn’t knock, build a door.
The secret is contained in a three-part formula I learned in the gym: self-confidence, a positive mental attitude, and honest hard work.
Our greatest weakness lies in giving up. The most certain way to succeed is always to try just one more time.
There is a sense that things, if you keep positive and optimistic about what can be done, do work out.

It took me quite a long time to develop a voice, and now that I have it, I am not going to be silent.

Sometimes the bad things that happen in our lives put us directly on the path to the best things that will ever happen to us.

Continue to be bold, courageous. Try to chose the wisest thing and once you’ve chosen the wisest thing go out and try to achieve it. Be it.
Start living in discomfort. Gradually increase it little by little, and you will steadily grow. If you want sudden growth, deluge yourself in great discomfort and do not retreat from it. The more discomfort you are willing to bear, the more you can grow. 
It takes a lot of courage to release the familiar and seemingly secure, to embrace the new. But there is no real security in what is no longer meaningful. There is more security in the adventurous and exciting, for in movement there is life, and in change there is power.

Courage is not simply one of the virtues, but the form of every virtue at the testing point, which means at the point of highest reality.
Whatever we learn to do, we learn by actually doing it; men come to be builders, for instance, by building, and harp players by playing the harp. In the same way, by doing just acts we come to be just; by doing self-controlled acts, we come to be self-controlled; and by doing brave acts, we become brave.
If you want to get an idea of a friend’s temperament, ethics, and personal elegance, you need to look at him under the tests of severe circumstances, not under the regular rosy glow of daily life.
It certainly takes bravery to remain skeptical; it takes inordinate courage to introspect, to confront oneself, to accept one’s limitations – Scientists are seeing more and more evidence that we are specifically designed by mother nature to fool ourselves.
The paradox of learning is that to get better, you need to go outside your comfort zone, and thus feel worse. The people who grow continuously, thus feel consistently over their heads.
Integrity is choosing courage over comfort; it’s choosing what’s right over what’s fun, fast, or easy; and it’s practicing your values, not just professing them.
The only way to solve a problem is to go through it rather than around it.
Self-knowledge is no guarantee of happiness, but it is on the side of happiness and can supply the courage to fight for it.

Without courage, wisdom bears no fruit.
We could never learn to be brave and patient if there were only joy in the world.
Whatever you do, you need courage. Whatever course you decide upon, there is always someone to tell you that you are wrong. There are always difficulties arising that tempt you to believe your critics are right. To map out a course of action and follow it to an end requires some of the same courage that a soldier needs. Peace has its victories, but it takes brave men and women to win them.

I’m proud of you. I hope that you are proud of you too.
You’re tired and scared. Happens to everyone, okay? Just don’t let your feet stop.
Soon, when all is well, you’re going to look back on this period of your life and be so glad that you never gave up.
Trying and struggling looks like incompetence right up until the moment it looks like success.
No matter what, just keep going.
There are far, far better things ahead than any we leave behind.
But if a thing is humanly possible, consider it to be within your reach.

The path through trouble is always made a step at a time, a breath at a time, a day at a time.
Not seeing results? Feel like giving up? Consider this: the last thing to grow on a fruit tree… is the fruit. Doing amazing sh*t takes time. You want that fruit you gotta stay after it.
It’s not too late to recover. You’re young, you’re tough. You’re adaptable. You can patch up your wounds, lift your head, and move on.
Get a move on…Don’t worry whether anyone will give you credit for it…Be satisfied with even the smallest progress, and treat the outcome of it all as unimportant.
The only way that you’re ever going to get to the other side of this journey is by suffering. You have to suffer in order to grow. Some people get it, some people don’t.
If you haven’t started, then taking action is more important than finding the best strategy. If you’re already taking action, then ensuring you’re working on the right thing is more important than working harder. Your effort sets your floor. Your strategy sets your ceiling.
Remember: everything hard will be painful, but just because there is pain doesn’t mean you have to suffer.
One of the most important skills I’ve built is the ability to sit with discomfort. Being able to be uncomfortable (bored, on the receiving end of anger, in pain) and not needing to escape has changed my happiness and my life.
The first step to overcoming failure is to fully admit you have failed. Admitting it will put your mind at ease and help you to see what you ought to do next.

Choose to be optimistic, it feels better.
Great spirits have always encountered violent opposition from mediocre minds.
When everything seems to be going against you, remember that the airplane takes off against the wind, not with it.
Everybody has goals, aspirations or whatever, and everybody has been at a point in their life where nobody believed in them.
Frame your mind to mirth and merriment which bars a thousand harms and lengthens life.
Not all storms come to disrupt your life, some come to clear your path.
In the midst of winter, I found there was, within me, an invincible summer.

You may not control all the events that happen to you, but you can decide not to be reduced by them.
It is impossible to live without failing at something unless you live so cautiously that you might as well not have lived at all, in which case you have failed by default.

Cultivate a fearless approach to life, attack everything with boldness and energy.
Reaching your dream will be tough. The road will be long and dark. But in the end, it will be worth it.
Remember how far you’ve come, not just how far you have to go. You are not where you want to be, but neither are you where you used to be.
If you want something, start working for it now. Don’t wait for anything. The clock is ticking.
You’re tired. You’re stressed. You’re mentally and physically drained. You feel alone. Struggling with the present, uncertain of the future. Life sucks right now. You’ll be fine. I promise…It gets better. Just keep moving forward.
You can be ten times what you are today at anything. And the only thing that holds you back is disciplined effort and a refusal to quit.
Be comforted, dear soul! There is always light behind the clouds.
Every day do something that will inch you closer to a better tomorrow.

There is something in the human spirit that will survive and prevail, there is a tiny and brilliant light burning in the heart of man that will not go out no matter how dark the world becomes.
A word of encouragement from a teacher to a child can change a life. A word of encouragement from a spouse can save a marriage. A word of encouragement from a leader can inspire a person to reach her potential.
Treat a man as he is and he will remain as he is. Treat a man as he can and should be and he will become as he can and should be.
When you have something you want to do in your life: Just fuc*ing do it. Don’t second guess yourself, don’t overthink it. Go with your instincts and have a bias to action. 
Some people spend their whole lives waiting for the sound of a starting gun that never goes off. Don’t wait. Pull the trigger yourself.
Replace every “what if” with “why the hell not?”

There is hardship in everything except eating pancakes.
Almost everything will work again if you unplug it for a few minutes, including you.
Courage in the path is what makes the path manifest itself.
You either walk inside your own story and own it, or you stand outside your story and hustle for your worthiness. 
What if everything you are going through is preparing you for what you asked for? 
We are like the little branch that quivers during a storm, doubting our strength and forgetting we are the tree – deeply rooted to withstand all of life’s upheavals.
The more you hope, the more you suffer. The more you suffer and keep going, the closer you get to your goal.
The darkest night that ever fell upon the earth never hid the light, never put out the stars. It only made the stars more keenly, kindly glancing, as if in protest against the darkness.
We deserve some respect. You deserve some respect. You are important to other people, as much as to yourself. You have some vital role to play in the unfolding destiny of the world.
Everything in life is a mind game! Whenever we get swept under by life’s dramas, large and small, we are forgetting that no matter how bad the pain gets, no matter how harrowing the torture, all bad things end.
Stop making excuses. Stop being a victim. Take personal responsibility. Hold yourself accountable. Get comfortable with the uncomfortable. And finally, make your dreams come true.
God uses suffering as a whetstone, to make men sharp with.
Curious that we spend more time congratulating people who have succeeded than encouraging people who have not.
We have to continually be jumping off cliffs and developing our wings on the way down.
Effort, not genetics, is within your control. Shane Parrish
Next to trying and winning, the best thing is trying and failing.
What is defeat? Nothing but education; nothing but the first steps to something better.
Nobody starts with all the answers. The path to the summit is not fully visible from base camp.
A fool’s answer is to work harder. A wise man stops, reflects, and simply takes the right direction.
Have patience. Wait until the mud settles and the water is clear. Remain unmoving until right action arises by itself.
Do not struggle. Go with the flow of things, and you will find yourself at one with the mysterious unity of the Universe.
On the path to successful action, we will fail – possibly many times. And that’s okay. It can be a good thing, even. Action and failure are two sides of the same coin. One doesn’t come without the other.
Dispelling dread isn’t a matter of trying to forget about washing dishes. It is realizing that in actual fact you only have one dish to wash, ever: this one; only one step to take, ever: this one. And that is Zen.
When life is good, do not take it for granted. It will pass. When life falls apart, this too will pass. Life will have its unexpected turns.
Learn from your past experiences, but don’t get stuck in them. Your past should be a teacher, not a jailer. Don’t squander the present dueling with the shadows of the past. This moment is alive with possibility.
Accepting the inevitable is the beginning of strength and freedom. Embrace all chaos that is out of your control. This is how it is. Why should it be otherwise? Move the levers that are within your grasp. Sharpen the blade of will. Strike with precision. Accept and endure.
Nothing is ever as it seems. What looks bad today, can be a blessing tomorrow.
Where you stumble and fall, there you will find gold.
I did get knocked down flat in front of the whole world, and I rose. I didn’t run away – I rose right where I’d been knocked down. And then that’s how you get to know yourself. You say, hmm, I can get up! I have enough of life in me to make somebody jealous enough to want to knock me down. I have so much courage in me that I have the effrontery, the incredible gall to stand up. That’s it. That’s how you get to know who you are.

Do not depend on the hope of results. You may have to face the fact that your work will be apparently worthless and even achieve no result at all, if not perhaps results opposite to what you expect.

To be hopeful in bad times is based on the fact that human history is not only of cruelty, but also of compassion, sacrifice, courage, kindness. If we see only the worst, it destroys our capacity to do something. If we remember those times and places where people have behaved magnificently, this gives us the energy to act. And if we do act, in however small a way, we don’t have to wait for some grand Utopian future. The future is an infinite succession of presents, and to live now as we think human beings should live, in defiance of all that is bad around us, is itself a marvelous victory.
Nothing worth doing is completed in our lifetime, therefore, we are saved by hope. Nothing true or beautiful or good makes complete sense in any immediate context of history; Therefore, we are saved by faith. Nothing we do, however virtuous, can be accomplished alone. Therefore, we are saved by love. No virtuous act is quite a virtuous from the standpoint of our friend or foe as from our own; Therefore, we are saved by the final form of love which is forgiveness.
Listen to the exhortation of the dawn! Look to this day! For it is life, the very life of life. In its brief course lie all the Verities and realities of your existence. The bliss of growth, The glory of action, The splendor of beauty; For yesterday is but a dream, And to-morrow is only a vision; But to-day well lived makes Every yesterday a dream of happiness, And every tomorrow a vision of hope. Look well therefore to this day! Such is the salutation of the dawn!
For what it’s worth… it’s never too late, or in my case too early, to be whoever you want to be. There’s no time limit. Start whenever you want. You can change or stay the same. There are no rules to this thing. We can make the best or the worst of it. I hope you make the best of it. I hope you see things that startle you. I hope you feel things you’ve never felt before. I hope you meet people who have a different point of view. I hope you live a life you’re proud of, and if you’re not, I hope you have the courage to start over again.
To love means loving the unlovable. To forgive means pardoning the unpardonable. Faith means believing the unbelievable. Hope means hoping when everything seems hopeless.
With despair, true optimism begins: the optimism of the man who expects nothing, who knows he has no rights and nothing coming to him, who rejoices in counting on himself alone and in acting alone for the good of all.

Old George Orwell got it backward. Big Brother isn’t watching. He’s singing and dancing. He’s pulling rabbits out of a hat. Big Brother’s busy holding your attention every moment you’re awake. He’s making sure you’re always distracted. He’s making sure you’re fully absorbed. He’s making sure your imagination withers. Until it’s as useful as your appendix. He’s making sure your attention is always filled. And this being fed, it’s worse than being watched. With the world always filling you, no one has to worry about what’s in your mind. With everyone’s imagination atrophied, no one will ever be a threat to the world

In today’s society, independent thinking is revolutionary activity where the human mind is bombarded with commercial aspiration.

In an information-rich world, the wealth of information means a dearth of something else: a scarcity of whatever it is that information consumes. What information consumes is rather obvious: it consumes the attention of its recipients. Hence a wealth of information creates a poverty of attention and a need to allocate that attention efficiently among the overabundance of information sources that might consume it.
Bring the mind into sharp focus and make it alert so that it can immediately intuit truth, which is everywhere. The mind must be emancipated from old habits, prejudices, restrictive thought processes and even ordinary thought itself.

There are times you’ll need to be wide open. There are times you’ll need to narrowly focused. Choose your perspective wisely.
Just focus on the one or two really really important things, and everything else, just surrender to it.
When you slow down, you can focus better. It’s hard to focus if you’re moving to fast.
One must say yes in order to develop. The young can benefit from saying yes to everything. Novel experiences reveal unknown talents and inclinations. Experience also reveals that many “opportunities” are only a chance to trade your time away. One must say no in order to focus.
Note when your attention drifts. Note what it drifts to. Identify what you find instinctively captivating. This may be valuable information about what you are capable of focusing deeply on.
Focus on what you control. Your habits. Your responses. Your ability to learn. Your ability to think. These are controllable and give you massive tailwinds.
It’s not the chatter of people around us that is the most powerful distractor, but rather the chatter of our own minds. Utter concentration demands these inner voices be stilled.
Make sure every day you do what matters most. When you know what matters most, everything makes sense. When you don’t know what matters most, anything makes sense.
It’s not always that we need to do more but rather that we need to focus on less.
First of all, it’s the ability to focus. When you train the mind to focus on something like the breath, it also gives you the discipline to focus on much bigger things and to really tell the difference between what’s important and everything else.
The ability to stay focused will be the superpower of the 21st century.
To be concentrated means to live fully in the present.
Focus all your attention and energy on the achievement of the objectives you are involved with right now.
In this modern age, being able to stay focused on one thing for an extended period of time is what will separate you from the rest.
The time that leads to mastery is dependent on the intensity of our focus.
Attention is the most mispriced asset on the planet. People give it away for nothing online, and tech companies resell it for a fraction of its value.
Most people focus too much on what’s going to happen next, and not enough on what’s happening now.
The artists who endure are the ones who stay focused even after they have reached the top of their profession.
Whenever you want to achieve something, keep your eyes open, concentrate and make sure you know exactly what it is you want. No one can hit their target with their eyes closed.
The things you give your attention to are shaping you, even if you are only reacting against them. They are modulating your mood and filling your head with fantasy scenarios. Pay attention to what you’re paying attention to. Become conscious of your focus and guide it.
Modern tech allows us access to so many voices. You have to turn them off sometimes if you want to be able to hear yourself think.
It is fruitless to look back and wish you had used your time differently. That kind of narcissism was what wasted so much time in the first place. Learn your lesson. Don’t wallow. Don’t relive the past. Turn your attention to the present.
The past is a memory, the future an illusion. Every moment is the only reality and each deserves our full attention.
If your attention-span is a muscle, meditation is exercise.
Learn to maintain your attention span – just as the 99% are losing this ability to social media and on demand entertainment, you should be gaining it.
Attention works much like a muscle. Use it poorly and it can wither; work it well and it grows.
It feels like we’re going through life in a state of “continuous partial attention”. We’re there but not really there. Unaware of where we place our attention. Unconscious about how we live.
The power of concentration is the only key to the treasure-house of knowledge.
The field of consciousness is tiny. It accepts only one problem at a time.
The more you focus, the more that focus becomes a habit.
You need to be doing fewer things for more effect instead of doing more things with side effects.
Know what you want. Clarity is power. And vague goals promote vague results.
Clarity about what matters provides clarity about what does not.
Less mental clutter means more mental resources available for deep thinking.
Meditation helps concentration of the mind. Then the mind is free from thoughts and is in the meditated form.
Gather all the information you can, work like hell on it, then take a break. Walk, meditate, journal, sleep, nap. By taking a step back, you’ll gain clarify and a new perspective.
The more clarity you achieve, the more you will find that the universe is on your side, supporting your thoughts and intentions. Therefore, focus on clarity, not on getting results. The results will come according to their own rhythm and timing
Short-term thinking makes people desperate, ungenerous, impulsive. Long-term thinking makes people calm, gracious, controlled. The mighty pyramids and cathedrals were built by civilizations with a long time horizon, so it is with the life of a great man.
A valuable long term mission can easily be derailed by emotionally loaded (but ultimately meaningless) short term drama. Focus on what matters.
Time spent undistracted and alone, in self-examination, journaling, meditation, resolves the unresolved and takes us from mentally fat to fit.
The more your mind is occupied by involuntary thoughts, the less working memory is available, which means less cognitive processing power. For your cognitive machinery to work at its optimal capacity, you must clear it of unwanted data, and free up more mental space.
Once you have clarity that something does not deserve your time and attention, be ruthless.
It’s very important that we re-learn the art of resting and relaxing. Not only does it help prevent the onset of many illnesses that develop through chronic tension and worrying; it allows us to clear our minds, focus, and find creative solutions to problems.
Clarity of mind means clarity of passion, too; this is why a great and clear mind loves ardently and sees distinctly what he loves.
Prioritizing sharpens your vision so you can focus on the most important things.
A clear vision, backed by definite plans, gives you a tremendous feeling of confidence and personal power.
You must first clearly see a thing in your mind before you can do it.
Clarity affords focus.
Stay focused, ignore the distractions, and you will accomplish your goals much faster.
Distractions are eating away the prime of your life. You probably know this vaguely but don’t realize it deeply enough to take action.
In ancient times having power meant having access to data. Today having power means knowing what to ignore. 
I don’t have a smartphone. My attention is one of the most important resources I have, and the smartphone is constantly trying to grab my attention. There’s always something coming in.
Corporations are using tech to reprogram you into a dependent consumer. Use tech to transform yourself into an independent producer.
Your time, focus and attention are your most valuable assets. That’s why companies try to trick you with drama. Stay alert.
One way to boost our will power and focus is to manage our distractions instead of letting them manage us.
Multitasking divides your attention and leads to confusion and weakened focus.
Mindfulness creates centered awareness. When you do one thing at a time, you’re guaranteed excellent results. If you do too many things simultaneously, it messes up your neural circuits.
Once the Internet came along, I think it destroyed everyone’s attention span. Now all of humanity’s works are available to you at any given time and you’re being interrupted constantly. Our attention span goes down, our ability to focus goes down.
Distractions secretly steal the most precious thing you have in your life – Time.
The average American watches over 30 hours of television a week. How many would say they have a project they’d love to do if only they “had the time?”
Modern humans overdose on information, pushing the limits of our design constraints. Future humans will adopt filtering mechanisms to avoid drowning in random data. They’ll look back on us with pity. Attention pollution is a huge drain on our collective intellectual resources.
We evolved in environments where it made sense to overreact to every threat. A lion in the grass requires an immediate reaction. Strike or be struck. Our threat detection systems are not designed for modern life and are easily exploited by cynical marketers and propagandists.
If you are easily provoked you are easily controlled.
Social media is very positive and profitable for a narrow set of people at the top of the distribution and is likely a net negative for almost everyone else. Most haven’t developed the skills to use it well. It captures a lot of attention and emotion for generally little reward.
Mobile phones should be called distraction machines. Checking your distraction machine first thing in the morning is not the ideal way to start your day.
Entertainment hubs masquerading as productivity devices – the perfect combo.
E-mail isn’t free. It seems free. It feels free.
Pollution can be smog from a factory or mental filth from mass media generated ideals.
Public attention is actually a nuisance and a distraction.
Too many people believe that everything must be pleasurable in life, which makes them constantly search for distractions and short-circuits the learning process.
What if you stopped listening to news or “current affairs”? Surely for most people it’ll bring a positive change in their life. Instead of the temporary, focus on the timeless which is always relevant. What is current is not necessarily important/relevant. Often it is just noise.
Deep thinking demands sustaining a focused mind. The more distracted we are, the more shallow our reflections; likewise, the shorter our reflections, the more trivial they are likely to be.
In life, drama is glamorized and used to usurp our attention. Advantages in life, however, are not based on drama but rather are the byproduct of doing mundane things every day really well without losing focus.
Focus is like a muscle. And if you’re like most people, your focus muscles have gotten weak due to your constant multitasking, web-surfing, and busy-working.
Information diets are “additive through subtraction”, like literal diets. Don’t focus on what you should consume but on what you shouldn’t.
If you want to win the war for attention, don’t try to say ‘no’ to the trivial distractions you find on the information smorgasbord; try to say ‘yes’ to the subject that arouses a terrifying longing, and let the terrifying longing crowd out everything else.
Once you’re wired for distraction, you crave it.
Don’t take breaks from distraction. Instead take breaks from focus.
To succeed with deep work you must rewire your brain to be comfortable resisting distracting stimuli.
Keep things simple, focused and effective by single-tasking.
Until my ONE thing is done, everything else is a distraction.
What you focus on grows, what you think about expands, and what you dwell upon determines your destiny.
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Discipline is choosing between what you want now, and what you want most.
The more self-discipline you have, the more you do the things you should do, the happier your future self will be.
The successful among us delay gratification. The successful among us bargain with the future.
No random actions, none not based on underlying principles.
We don’t rise to the level of our expectations; we fall to the level of our training.
Everyone can perform magic, everyone can reach his goals, if he is able to think, if he is able to wait, if he is able to fast.
In the end, you win through superior craftsmanship, not marketing.
The senses have been conditioned by attraction to the pleasant and aversion to the unpleasant. Do not be ruled by them.
Do the best one can. Do it over again. Then still improve, even if ever so slightly, those retouches.
No man is free who cannot command himself.
If I don’t have a project, I don’t have any discipline.
Routine, in an intelligent man, is a sign of ambition.
What is truly ambitious is to face life and proceed with quiet confidence in spite of the distractions.
Day by day, what you choose, what you think and what you do is who you become.
Avoid things the best version of yourself will regret.
Discipline equals freedom. 
Excess in anything becomes a fault.
This is the main question, with what activity one’s leisure is filled.
Self-discipline raises you, self-control prevents you from falling.
Focus is free but distractions cost you everything.
We require routine and tradition. That’s order. Order can become excessive, and that’s not good, but chaos can swamp us, so we drown – and that is also not good. We need to stay on the straight and narrow path
You cannot aim yourself at anything if you are completely undisciplined and untutored.
How we spend our days is of course how we spend our lives.
Curb your desire – don’t set your heart on so many things and you will get what you need.
One thousand days of lessons for discipline; ten thousand days of lessons for mastery.
If there isn’t discipline, how can there be a true realization of an ideal?
Freedom and responsibility are two aspects of the same coin. If you are not ready to feel responsible, you will never be free.
The number of people who stand ready to consume one’s time, to no purpose, is almost countless.
Society primarily encourages distraction, distraction in every form.
Your first blog post will be bad, but your 1000th will be great. Your first workout will be weak, but your 1000th will be strong. Your first meditation will be scattered, but your 1000th will be focused. Put in your reps.
Small things, done consistently in strategic places, create major impact.
Most of us spend too much time on what is urgent and not enough time one what is important.
He who conquers his passions is a man of more nerve than he who subdues the enemy.
To be occupied in what does not concern you is worse than doing nothing.
To forget one’s purpose is the commonest form of stupidity.
Dignity grows with the ability to say no to oneself.
There’s nothing more powerful than paying attention.
Discipline is remembering what you want.
Discipline is your relationship with the time you have left.
Discipline is being able to force yourself to do something is spite of how you feel, over and over until it becomes a habit.
What is discipline? Discipline means creating an order within you.
Discipline is the bridge between goals and accomplishment.
Don’t be overheard complaining… Not even to yourself.
You can’t win the war against the world if you can’t win the war against your own mind.
There is nothing so disobedient as an undisciplined mind, and there is nothing so obedient as a disciplined mind.
Complete abstinence is easier than perfect moderation.
Don’t put off until tomorrow what you can do today.
While we are postponing, life speeds by.
Beware the barrenness of a busy life.
Not to have control over the senses is like sailing in a rudderless ship, bound to break to pieces on coming in contact with the very first rock.
My whole system of life is keeping at it. The task of life is not to see clearly in the distance but to do the task at hand.
We must all suffer one of two things: the pain of discipline or the pain of regret.
A person without self-control is like a city with broken-down walls.
It is felt that a disciplined mind leads to happiness and an undisciplined mind leads to suffering, and in fact it is said that bringing about discipline within one’s mind is the essence of the Buddha’s teaching.
Good order and discipline in an army are more to be depended upon than ferocity.
How much time are you putting into your highest priorities?
Every fulfilled dream occurred because of dedication to a process.
The way you train reflects the way you fight. People say I’m not going to train too hard, I’m going to do this in training, but when it’s time to fight I’m going to step up. There is no step up. You’re just going to do what you did every day.
Self-control is the quality that distinguishes the fittest to survive.
Learn to convert the discomfort of discipline into the satisfaction of personal growth.
No discipline seems pleasant at the time, but painful. Later on, however, it produces a harvest of righteousness and peace for those who have been trained by it.
Do not bite at the bait of pleasure till you know there is no hook beneath it.
There’s no excuse.
Discipline over desire.
Nothing is stronger than habit.
Discipline is money in the bank.
Discipline must come through liberty.
Don’t get fat at the table of success.
Discipline comes from needs, not wants.
The disciplined man will ultimately win.
The whole point is to discipline the mind.
I choose to live by choice, not by chance.
Progress is the pursuit of better process.
Do what the person you want to be would do.
No man is free who is not master of himself.
How would the person I wish to be act today?
Amateurs get distracted. Pros just keep going.
Poverty or abundance are the results of habits overtime.
Discipline will take you to places where motivation can’t.
Good choices create leverage. Good habits capitalize on it.
Concentrate on a single goal, a single task, and beat it into submission.
The future depends entirely on what each of us does every day.
Such power there is in clear-eyed self-restraint.
Can you imagine yourself in 10 years if instead of avoiding the things you know you should do, you actually did them every single day – that’s powerful.
Practice is the price you pay today to be better tomorrow.
Every action you take is kind of like a vote for the kind of person you want to become.
You must be disciplined in thought, word, and deed. Consciously train yourself to do those things that are good for you.
To understand success, pay less attention to the final product and more to the mundane process. […] The seeds of greatness are planted in the daily grind.
Want to become a writer? Write every day. Want to become a YouTuber? Upload videos every day. Want to learn a new skill? Practice is every day. You become what you do every day.
Daily affirmations are great. Daily reminders are better. Daily actions are best.
If you manage your time like it’s worth a lot of money, it eventually will.
Good habits are personal capital. They require investment, but many pay off 1000X over a lifetime.
Have goals that are challenging enough to intimidate others.
Success is the sum of small efforts, repeated day in and day out.
Progress is not achieved by luck or accident, but by working on yourself daily.
An idiot with a plan can beat a genius without a plan.
Everyone says that no one gets to their deathbed and thinks, man I wish I worked more, but I don’t think anyone gets to their deathbed and says, man I’m glad I spent all that time skiing in Aspen.
The costs of your good habits are in the present. The costs of your bad habits are in the future.
You can be self-disciplined, or you can be a slave.
Impatience is a virtue. Self-discipline is another form of self-conflict. Find things that excite you.
You become what you give your attention to…If you yourself don’t choose what thoughts and images you expose yourself to, someone else will.
Discipline is the ability to get yourself to do what you don’t want to do. When used occasionally, it keeps you from getting soft. When used frequently, it’s a sign of strategic misalignment
It’s easier to put off until tomorrow what needs to be done today, and drown the upcoming months and years in today’s cheap pleasures.
Understand: like everyone, you think you are rational, but you are not. Rationality is not a power you are born with, but one you acquire through training and practice.
In walking about as you take care not to step on a nail or to sprain your foot, so take care not to damage your own ruling faculty: and if we observe this rule in every act, we shall undertake the act with more security.
You don’t have the time to meditate because you don’t meditate. You don’t have the energy to exercise because you don’t exercise. You don’t have money to save because you don’t save money.
Increase your awareness of your own mortality and you will do more of what matters.
Nothing great was ever created without focus and an inability to focus is the fastest way to kill potential. 
Discipline when you hate yourself is tyranny. Discipline when you love yourself is the path to freedom. 
Do what you hate to do, but do it like you love it.
Freedom is not the ability to do as we please. Freedom is the ability to do as we ought.
The time that leads to mastery is dependent on the intensity of our focus.
Zen is not some kind of excitement but concentration on our usual everyday routine.
When you know what matters to you, it’s a lot easier to ignore what doesn’t.
One ought not to give way in everything nor to everybody. To know how to refuse is therefore as important as to know how to consent.
Silence is essential. It’s a tool, a sign of wisdom, a sign of self-control and self-discipline. It can be, in some cases, more courageous and fair to bite your tongue than it is to flap it.
This can be swiftly taught in very few words: virtue is the only good; there is no certain good without virtue; and virtue resides in our nobler part, which is the rational one. And what can this virtue be? True and steadfast judgment.
Perpetual devotion to what a man calls his business, is only to be sustained by perpetual neglect of many other things.
We must not, in trying to think about how we can make a big difference, ignore the small daily differences we can make which, over time, add up to big differences that we often cannot foresee.
Discipline is persuasion of the self. When you’re ready, you’ll need no persuasion.
Routine and habit are the only reliable tools for improving yourself and your situation. Every single person you think is cool got that way by regularly doing things that made them a better person, whether they felt like it in the moment or not.
Love the discipline you know, and let it support you. Entrust everything willingly to the gods, and then make your way through life – no one’s master and no one’s slave.
A warrior must subdue himself before he can subdue his enemies. Clear eyes see accurately. The quiet mind thinks calmly. The steady hand strikes decisively. Mad passion flares brightly and quickly burns itself out. Stoke the steady flames of discipline, wisdom, and will.
Discipline comes easy when you give yourself no other options.
We are most free when we are under discipline. Free from being ruled by fleshly impulse and worldly desire.
As a society moves from scarcity to abundance, the cultural value that is most likely to be underdeveloped is restraint.
Part 1. Your outcomes are a lagging measure of your habits. Your net worth is a lagging measure of your financial habits. Your weight is a lagging measure of your eating habits. Your knowledge is a lagging measure of your learning habits. You get what you repeat.
The more disciplined your environment is, the less disciplined you need to be. Don’t swim upstream.
Part 2. Your energy is a lagging measure of your sleep habits. Your fitness is a lagging measure of your exercise habits. Your clutter is a lagging measure of your cleaning habits.
A simple question with potentially wide-reaching implications: Can my current habits carry me to my desired future?
Discipline divorced from wisdom is not true discipline, but merely the meaningless following of custom, which is only a disguise for stupidity.
Always imagine yourself on the battlefield under the fiercest attack; never forget this crucial element of training.
If you want to win, practice virtue. If you win with virtue, your opponent buries himself.
It is better, proverbially, to rule your own spirit than to rule a city.
He watches himself as if he were an enemy and lying in ambush.
The only person you can control is you. So focus on making yourself who you want to be: Faster. Smarter. Stronger. More humble. Less ego.
The greatest portion of peace of mind is doing nothing wrong. Those who lack self-control live disoriented and disturbed lives.
It shows greater self-control to refuse to withdraw oneself, and to do the same things as the crowd, but in a different way.
True self-discipline is not for the weak-minded. In life we make too many excuses – I don’t live near a gym, don’t have the money for a trainer, my hours at work are crazy, I’m traveling too much, the kids schedules are too hectic, etc. The list is endless. Rather than giving yourself a way out, find a way to make “it” happen.
Self-discipline and self-control will determine the quality of your life more than anything else. Self-discipline to make you do what needs to be done. Self-control to keep you from doing what you shouldn’t.
When you’re working, work. When you’re playing, play. When you’re resting, rest. Too many people try to combine more than one of these. The result is that you’re either unproductive, interfering with your fun, or not re-charging your batteries. You can’t multi-task. Pick one!
Self-respects follows self-control and self-discipline.
Exercise authority over yourself, or you will be made to bow to the authority of others. Be your own lord and master.
Obesity is a problem in rich societies. Too much abundance, not enough self-control. The same can be said for “opportunities.” An abundance of opportunity offers many traps. Every yes is a no to everything else you could do. Choose your sacrifices intentionally.
I value self-discipline, but creating systems that make it next to impossible to misbehave is more reliable than self-control.
Conquest over one’s self; in the hour of victory, is a double triumph.
Don’t buy the book because it’s on sale. Don’t eat the pastries because they’re free. When most of the cost isn’t financial, do not be persuaded by price.
In the moment some choices seem small: we eat the chocolate bar, take a shortcut, or cancel a date. However, the accumulation of those tiny decisions adds up over months and years and makes a huge difference. Today’s choices become tomorrow’s reality.
The longer you delay that thing you know you should do, the more difficult it gets. The easier thing in the short run is often the harder thing in the long run. Pain today, gain tomorrow.
Learn to control your reactions or you will be puppeteered by anyone capable of provoking you.
Self-discipline is a great time-saver; it is the ability to make yourself work on only those things that are most important to you.
Habit, if not resisted, soon becomes necessity.
When we are tired, we are attacked by ideas we conquered long ago.
Complaining is one of the ego’s favorite strategies for strengthening itself.
Your first task is to look at those emotions that are continually infecting your ideas and decisions.
It is in fact the height of selfishness to merely consume what others create and to retreat into a shell of limited goals and immediate pleasures.
Living an undisciplined life isn’t freedom. It’s the ultimate version of slavery.
Some of y’all need to be fasting from things other than food: The news, social media, negative people, complaining, worrying, video games, alcohol, drugs. Especially if you can’t go without it.
Obsession without self-control leads to self-destruction.
Self-control is the root of all virtues which is why modern humans lack virtue.
No one has ever built a legacy consuming.
Good habits are assets. Bad habits are liabilities. What’s in your portfolio?
You will ascend to the level of your discipline. You will fall to the level of your apathy.
May even your hobbies improve your mind and body, and move you further away from the degenerate state of constant consumption.
It’s not that change is hard. It’s that not changing is easier.
Let me note all the sickening waste of today, that I shall not be easy with myself and compromise my tomorrows.
A schedule defends from chaos and whim. It is a net for catching days.
There’s no quick fix or fast pass to success. It doesn’t happen in a day; but it does happen daily.
You’ll never change your life until you change something you do daily. The secret of your success is found in your daily routine.
The secret of successful working lies in the systemic arrangement of what you have to do. I know of no better way to accomplish a large amount of work.
Once an action becomes automatic, you now have the mental space to observe yourself as you practice.
I keep this routine every day without variation. The repetition itself becomes the important thing; it’s a form of mesmerism. I mesmerize myself to reach a deeper state of mind.
A modern stoic knows that the surest way to discipline passion is to discipline time: decide what you want or ought to do during the day, then always do it at exactly the same moment every day, and passion will give you no trouble.
Changing habits: Pick one thing. Cultivate a desire. Visualize it. Plan a sustainable path. Identify needs, triggers, and substitutes. Tell your friends. Track meticulously. Self-discipline is a bridge to a new self-image. Bake in the new self-image. It’s who you are, now.
First forget inspiration. Habit is more dependable. Habit will sustain you whether you’re inspired or not. Habit is persistence in practice.
Results have little to do with the goals we set and nearly everything to do with the systems we follow. Goals are the results we want to achieve. Systems are the processes that lead to those results. If you want results, forget goals. Focus on your system.
The fact that you go to the gym even though you don’t “need” to is why you don’t need to. The fact that you save when you could spend is why you have money to spend. Your habits create your strength.
Your choices – what you work on, who you work with – create leverage. A good initial choice can deliver 100x payoff. Your habits unleash leverage. Without great habits, great choices are just potential energy.
All of your energy should go into building better rituals, not chasing better results.
Willpower is overrated. Figure out the systems that let you not have to use it.
People don’t decide their futures, they decide their habits and their habits decide their futures.
Be tolerant with others and strict with yourself.

___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________-
Quiet the mind, and the soul will speak. 
Learn to be calm and you will always be happy.
Do not dwell in the past, do not dream of the future, concentrate the mind on the present moment. 
Calmness of mind is one of the beautiful jewels of wisdom. 
Whatever is fluid, soft, and yielding will overcome whatever is rigid and hard. What is soft is strong. 
When meditation is mastered, the mind is unwavering like the flame of a candle in a windless place. 
When you own your breath, nobody can steal your peace. 
Nowhere can man find a quieter or more untroubled retreat than in his own soul. 
Your calm mind is the ultimate weapon against your challenges. So relax. 
When you realize there is nothing lacking, the whole world belongs to you. 
Meditation is not evasion; it is a serene encounter with reality. 
The best meditation is effortless. The best meditation is a gentle awareness. 
Learn to slow down. Get lost intentionally. Observe how you judge both yourself and those around you. 
Suffering is due to our disconnection with the inner soul. Meditation is establishing that connection. 
The more tranquil a man becomes, the greater is his success, his influence, his power for good. 
Whatever state I am in, I see it as a state of mind to be accepted as it is. 
Meditation is the art of doing nothing. 
Praying is talking to the Universe. Meditation is listening to it. 
You must find the place inside yourself where nothing is impossible. 
A few conscious-hearted, sincere, and energetic men and women can do more in a year than a mob in a century. 
To really do nothing, with perfection, is as difficult as doing everything. 
You have a treasure within you that is infinitely greater than anything the world can offer. 
Wisdom comes with the ability to be still. Just look and listen. No more is needed. 
Be here now. Be someplace else later. Is that so complicated? 
Live the actual moment. Only this actual moment is life. 
Don’t seek, don’t search, don’t ask, don’t knock, don’t demand – relax. 
The mind is definitely something that can be transformed, and meditation is a means to transform it. 
Meditation practice isn’t about trying to throw ourselves away and become something better. It’s about befriending who we are already. 
In practicing meditation, we’re not trying to live up to some kind of ideal – quite the opposite. We’re just being with our experience, whatever it is. 
Buddha spent six years meditating on the essence, causes, and cures for human anguish. In the end, he came to the realization that suffering is not caused by ill fortune, by social injustice, or by divine whims. Rather, suffering is caused by the behavior patterns of one’s minds. 
When we are unable to find tranquility within ourselves, it is useless to seek it elsewhere. 
You are more than just your mind. You are more than just your habits. You are more than just your preferences. You’re a level of awareness. 
To be concentrated means to live fully in the present. 
Meditation is the discovery that the point of life is always arrived at in the immediate moment. 
Paradise is not a place, it’s a state of consciousness. 
Meditation is all about connecting with your soul. 
Meditation is the soul’s perspective glass. 
Meditation is the ultimate mobile device; you can use it anywhere, anytime, unobtrusively. 
Meditation is intermittent fasting for the mind. Too much sugar leads to a heavy body, and too many distractions lead to a heavy mind. Time spent undistracted and alone, in self-examination, journaling, meditation, resolves the unresolved and takes us from mentally fat to fit. 
Meditation is to be aware of every thought and of every feeling, never to say it is right or wrong but just to watch it and move with it. 
Meditation is freedom from thought and a movement in the ecstasy of truth. Meditation is explosion of intelligence. 
Meditation is not a withdrawal from life. Meditation is a process of understanding oneself. 
Meditation is a death – death of all that you are now. Of course there will be a resurrection, but that will be a totally new, fresh original being which you are not even aware is hidden in you. 
Meditation is a way for nourishing and blossoming the divine within you. 
Meditation is not spacing-out or running away. In fact, it is being totally honest with ourselves. 
Mindfulness meditation is the embrace of any and all mind states in awareness, without preferring one to another. 
Mindfulness is an essential survival thing. 
Confine yourself to the present. 
Sleep is the best meditation. 
All of man’s difficulties are caused by his inability to sit, quietly, in a room by himself. 
On what meditation did for him: Everything. You know, one of the great things of meditation is it makes stress very easy to get rid of. It just kind of floats away instead of like finding a home in your mind. You learn how to just let go of things. 
If you just sit and observe, you will see how restless your mind is. If you try to calm it, it only makes it worse, but over time it does calm, and when it does, there’s room to hear more subtle things – that’s when your intuition starts to blossom and you start to see things more clearly and be in the present more. Your mind just slows down, and you see a tremendous expanse in the moment. You see so much more than you could see before. 
The key to growth is the introduction of higher dimensions of consciousness into our awareness. 
Your vision will become clear only when you look into your heart. Who looks outside, dreams. Who looks inside, awakens. 
There are only two ways to live your life. One is as though nothing is a miracle. The other is as though everything is a miracle. 
Be happy in the moment, that’s enough. Each moment is all we need, not more. 
Through meditation, the higher self is experienced. 
One hour of contemplation surpasses sixty years of worship. 
We are what our thoughts have made us; so take care about what you think. Words are secondary. Thoughts live; they travel far. 
I know but one freedom and that is the freedom of the mind. 
Within you there is a stillness and sanctuary to which you can retreat at any time and be yourself. 
Reading makes a full man, meditation a profound man, discourse a clear man. 
Empty your mind, be formless. Shapeless, like water. 
If your mind is empty, it is always ready for anything; it is open to everything. In the beginner’s mind there are many possibilities, in the expert’s mind there are few. 
Meditation is the dissolution of thoughts in eternal awareness or Pure consciousness without objectification, knowing without thinking, merging finitude in infinity. 
The best cure for the body is a quiet mind. 
Meditate. Slow down. There’s no rush. 
Meditation is the action of silence. 
Life is available only in the present moment. 
Breathe and let be. 
Wherever you go, there you are. 
Meditation is the act of stopping to deny what is. 
Self-observation is the first step of inner unfolding. 
Be present above all else. 
Mind only thinks, meditation lives. 
The act of meditation is being spacious. 
Do your practice and all is coming. 
Turn off your mind and get to know yourself. 
The quiet mind is richer than a crown. 
Whatever anyone does or says, I must be emerald and keep my colour. 
Truth is the offspring of silence and meditation. 
Tranquil as a forest, but on fire within, once you find your center, you are sure to win. 
Whenever we attain a higher vision, the lower vision disappears of itself. 
One morning, you’ll hit mental inbox zero, and that is a pretty amazing feeling. It’s a state somewhere between joy, bliss, and peace. Once you have that, you won’t want to give that up. If you can get a free hour of bliss every morning, just by closing your eyes…that’s worth its weight in gold. That will change your life. 
If every eight year old in the world is taught meditation, we will eliminate violence from the world within one generation. 
By the practice of meditation, you will find that you are carrying within your heart a portable paradise. 
He who is persistent will realize God. So try your best to make meditation a regular experience in your life. 
If you meditate regularly, even when you don’t feel like it, you will make great gains, for it will allow you to see how your thoughts impose limits on you. Your resistances to meditation are your mental prisons in miniature. 
Every heart has a divine intelligence and natural guidance system. With every prayer, every meditation and every thought of love, we tune in to ours. 
Don’t worry about whether you are making progress or not. Just keep your attention on the Self twenty-four hours a day. Meditation is not something that should be done in a particular position at a particular time. It is an awareness and an attitude that must persist through the day. 
Concentration is a cornerstone of mindfulness practice. Your mindfulness will only be as robust as the capacity of your mind to be calm and stable. Without calmness, the mirror of mindfulness will have an agitated and choppy surface and will not be able to reflect things with any accuracy. 
Whenever anyone has offended me, I try to raise my soul so high that the offense cannot reach it. 
Sitting like a mountain let your mind rise, fly and soar. 
You are the sky. Everything else is just the weather. 
If it weren’t for my mind, my meditation would be excellent. 
It’s like having a charger for your whole body and mind. 
Meditation is a way to be narcissistic without hurting anyone.
Meditation is the weight room for the mind. 
To earn the trust of your meditation, you have to visit it every day. It’s like having a puppy. 
It feels good. Kinda like when you have to shut your computer down, just sometimes when it goes crazy, you just shut it down and when you turn it on, it’s okay again. That’s what meditation is to me. 
SEX! Now that I have your attention… Please try to meditate at least 15 minutes, every day. You know it’s good for you. 
A few hours of meditation were enough to show me that I hardly had any control of myself. I was not the CEO – I was barely the gatekeeper. 
So what is a good meditator? The one who meditates. 
You should sit in meditation for twenty minutes a day, unless you are too busy — then you should sit for an hour. 
A quiet mind is more important than a positive mind. 
The little things? The little moments? They aren’t little. 
Only the individual transcends. 
Busy is a drug that a lot of people are addicted to. 
Meditation is not you going through thoughts – it’s letting thoughts go through you. 
If meditation was easy, you’d do nothing else. 
Modern man is too impatient and wants to master the art of meditation immediately. 
Life is a mystery – mystery of beauty, bliss and divinity. Meditation is the art of unfolding that mystery. 
Observe your thoughts, instead of being constantly the victim of your thoughts. 
A human mind is a wandering mind, and a wandering mind is an unhappy mind. 
You are not controlling the storm, and you are not lost in it. You are the storm. 
While meditating we are simply seeing what the mind has been doing all along. 
Practicing austerities such as yoga, mindfulness, and meditation will give you a front row seat to that which you will never attain and in the process make you an expert at forever seeking them. 
The challenge of our time is relearning how to concentrate. The past decade has seen an unparalleled assault on our capacity to fix our minds steadily on anything. To sit still and think, without succumbing to an anxious reach for a machine, has become almost impossible. 
People have original thoughts in the shower because it is one of the only places in modern life that offers refuge from entertainment, compulsive workaholism, and social hyperconnectedness. The isolation allows you to hear yourself think. Morning meditation for the masses. 
The beauty of meditation is that you never know where you are, where you are going, what the end is. 
I maintain that Truth is a pathless land, and you cannot approach it by any path whatsoever, by any religion, by any sect… The moment you follow someone you cease to follow Truth. 
If there is no meditation, then you are like a blind man in a world of great beauty, light and colour. 
We carry about us the burden of what thousands of people have said and the memories of all our misfortunes. To abandon all that is to be alone, and the mind that is alone is not only innocent but young – not in time or age, but young, innocent, alive at whatever age – and only such a mind can see that which is truth and that which is not measurable by words. 
The most fundamental aggression to ourselves, the most fundamental harm we can do to ourselves, is to remain ignorant by not having the courage and the respect to look at ourselves honestly and gently. 
When we get too caught up in the busyness of the world, we lose connection with one another – and ourselves. 
Thought can organize the world so well that you are no longer able to see it. 
Awareness is like the sun. When it shines on things, they are transformed. 
Walk as if you are kissing the Earth with your feet. 
Don’t believe everything you think. Thoughts are just that – thoughts. 
Perhaps ultimately, spiritual simply means experiencing wholeness and interconnectedness directly, a seeing that individuality and the totality are interwoven, that nothing is separate or extraneous. If you see in this way, then everything becomes spiritual in its deepest sense. Doing science is spiritual. So is washing the dishes. 
Many people are alive but don’t touch the miracle of being alive. 
In the beginning you will fall into the gaps in between thoughts – after practicing for years, you become the gap. 
You’re actually in deep meditation all the time. It’s just covered up by all the noise, and all the thoughts, and all the emotional things that are running through you. It’s always there underneath. 
Doing nothing is really hard for us, since we’re such a productivity-driven culture and species. 
You can have the mind or you can have the moment. 
When you’re centered, your emotions are not hijacking you. 
The game is not about becoming somebody, it’s about becoming nobody. 
To become different from what we are, we must have some awareness of what we are. 
Be the master of mind rather than mastered by mind. 
Be the witness of your thoughts. You are what observes, not what you observe. 
Wisdom tends to grow in proportion to one’s awareness of one’s ignorance. 
The whole life is a succession of dreams. My ambition is to be a conscious dreamer, that is all. 
The time to relax is when you don’t have time for it. 
Even in the midst of disturbance, the stillness of the mind can offer sanctuary. 
Meditation is turning off society and listening to yourself. It only “works” when done for its own sake. Hiking is walking meditation. Journaling is writing meditation. Praying is gratitude meditation. Showering is accidental meditation. Sitting quietly is direct meditation. 
The advantage of meditation is recognizing just how out of control your mind is. 
The only difference between meditation and ordinary social interaction is that the friend you’re gradually coming to know is yourself. 
Like water which can clearly mirror the sky and the trees only so long as its surface is undisturbed, the mind can only reflect the true image of the Self when it is tranquil and wholly relaxed. 
Meditation could be said to be the Art of Simplicity: simply sitting, simply breathing and simply being. 
Meditation is the only intentional, systematic human activity which at bottom is about not trying to improve yourself or get anywhere else, but simply to realize where you already are. 
Instead of “Let it go,” we should probably say “Let it be”; this recognizes that the mind won’t let go and the problem may not go away, and it allows you to form a healthier relationship with what’s bothering you. 
What would it be like if I could accept life – accept this moment – exactly as it is? 
Be at least as interested in what goes on inside you as what happens outside. If you get the inside right, the outside will fall into place. 
Abraham Lincoln said, “Give me six hours to chop down a tree and I will spend the first four sharpening the axe”. You have 24 to chop every day. Sleep, exercise, meditation, reading – those are some of your sharpening tools. Do not chop for 18 hours with a blunt axe. 
The affairs of the world will go on forever. Do not delay the practice of meditation. 
Meditation is not a means to an end. It is both the means and the end. 
Muddy water is best cleared by leaving it alone. 
One conscious breath in and out is a meditation. 
Don’t try to solve anything, just “be”. 
I just started with watching my breath and evolved from there. 
No intentions, just be. There can’t be any formula. It’s available to everyone or not at all. 
No apps, no noise, no guidance. Sit in a comfortable position first thing in the morning, back upright, but ok to use cushions etc.. One hour at a time, no less. Just surrender to and accept whatever happens. No energy for and no energy against. Resist and reject nothing. 
No effort. You’re just going to sit there and let whatever happens happen. 
If you have thoughts that’s perfectly ok. Let the thoughts happen. The key word is Surrender (to whatever is happening). 
Tell yourself when you sit down, “my job is to do nothing. I’m taking a well deserved break from myself.”
It’s hard to recommend a routine as it’s the ultimate single-player game. Try them all and see which one works for you. (Try routine 1, routine 2, routine 3)
This will summon a horde of angry people but I would skip TM [Transcendental Meditation] and apps. No systems, no interference. Pick a dark, quiet place, first thing in the morning, just sit and observe (your breath). Let everything go, surrender to what happens. One hour per day for one week straight. 
Sit down, close your eyes, get in a comfortable position, and whatever happens, happens. If you think, you think. If you don’t think, you don’t think. Don’t put any effort into it. 
Please, when you practice meditation, don’t make any effort. Allow yourself to be like a pebble at rest. The pebble is resting at the bottom of a river, and the pebble does not have to do anything. While you are a walking, you are resting. While you were sitting, you are resting. 
When sitting in meditation, say, “That’s not my business!” with every thought that comes by. 
When you begin to meditate you may notice changes right away. Or nothing much may seem to change. Don’t count on anything dramatic. Most changes happen slowly. 
Meditate every single day. Not once in a while. Every single day. 
8 Steps for meditating: 1. Sit comfortably, with your spine erect, either in a chair or cross-legged on a cushion. 2. Close your eyes, take a few deep breaths, and feel the points of contact between your body and the chair or the floor. Notice the sensations associated with sitting — feelings of pressure, warmth, tingling, vibration, etc. 3. Gradually become aware of the process of breathing. Pay attention to wherever you feel the breath most distinctly — either at your nostrils or in the rising and falling of your abdomen. 4. Allow your attention to rest in the mere sensation of breathing. (You don’t have to control your breath. Just let it come and go naturally.) 5. Every time your mind wanders in thought, gently return it to the breath. 6. As you focus on the process of breathing, you will also perceive sounds, bodily sensations, or emotions. Simply observe these phenomena as they appear in consciousness and then return to the breath. 7. The moment you notice that you have been lost in thought, observe the present thought itself as an object of consciousness. Then return your attention to the breath — or to any sounds or sensations arising in the next moment. 8. Continue in this way until you can merely witness all objects of consciousness — sights, sounds, sensations, emotions, even thoughts themselves — as they arise, change, and pass away.
To pray and work in the morning and to labor and rest in the afternoon, and to sit still again in meditation in the evening when night falls upon that land and when the silence fills itself with darkness and with stars. This is a true and special vocation. There are few who are willing to belong completely to such silence, to let it soak into their bones, to breathe nothing but silence, to feed on silence, and to turn the very substance of their life into a living and vigilant silence. 
Just sit, breathe, and pay attention to what it’s like to be you. Nothing to add. Nothing to take away. Nothing to fix, or change or do. Just you – sitting, breathing, paying attention. You are welcome here. Here you belong. Here you are enough. Breathe.

Stay centered by accepting whatever happens to you. This is the ultimate.
The nearer a man comes to a calm mind, the closer he is to strength. 
A fit body, a calm mind, a house full of love. These things cannot be bought – they must be earned. 
Your life will be in order when disorder ceases to bother you. 
People should learn how to just be there, doing nothing. 
You can’t force raging water to be calm. You have to leave it alone and let it return to its natural flow. Emotions are the same way. 
Insight emerges out of silence. 
When we are unable to find tranquility within ourselves, it is useless to seek it elsewhere. 
If he cannot stop the mind that seeks after fame and profit, he will spend his life without finding peace. 
Understand: presence of mind is the ability to detach yourself, to see the whole battlefield, the whole picture, with clarity. 
Those who act with few desires are calm, without worry or fear. 
To be calm is the highest achievement of the self. 
Decide that wherever you are, is the best place there is. Once you start comparing, there’s no end to it. 
Fear of change is a human instinct. Embracing change is a superhuman ability. 
Tension is who you think you should be. Relaxation is who you are. 
No state is so bitter than a calm mind cannot find in it some consolation. 
Rushing into action, you fail. Trying to grasp things, you lose them. Forcing a project to completion, you ruin what was almost ripe. 
With no desire, at rest and still, all things go right as of their will. 
If you relax, it comes. If you relax, it is there. If you relax, you start vibrating with it. 
Everything that happens is as simple and familiar as the rose in spring, the fruit in summer: disease, death, blasphemy, conspiracy… everything that makes stupid people happy and angry. 
To shrug it all off and wipe it clean — every annoyance and distraction — and reach utter stillness. Child’s play. 
The smarter you get, the more you appreciate silence. 
On average, the deeper people’s knowledge of a topic, the more calmly they talk about it. 
An infinite reservoir of cosmic wisdom resides in the depths of contemplation. 
Attain peace with self-understanding. Attain self-understanding with silence. 
Relax. You’ll live longer and perform better. 
Hurrying and delaying are alike ways of trying to resist the present. 
To bear trials with a calm mind robs misfortune of its strength and burden. 
When completely relaxed, we experience the essence of our being, the deep silence that knows everything as it is. 
We have a choice. We can spend our whole life suffering because we can’t relax with how things really are, or we can relax and embrace the open-endedness of the human situation, which is fresh, unfixated, and unbiased. 
One thing we do know: Life will give you whatever experience is most helpful for the evolution of your consciousness. How do you know this the experience you need? Because this is the experience you are having at this moment. 
Short-term thinking makes people desperate, ungenerous, impulsive. Long-term thinking makes people calm, gracious, controlled. The mighty pyramids and cathedrals were built by civilizations with a long time horizon, so it is with the life of a great man. 
Let come what comes, and accommodate yourself to that, whatever it is. 
If you feel offended about something, you haven’t been meditating enough. If you feel the need to defend yourself, or justify your opinion, you haven’t been meditating enough. If you can’t take joy in sitting under a tree on a beautiful day, you haven’t been meditating enough. 
Some time in your day today, try to turn off all the noises you can around you, and give yourself some ‘quiet time.’ In the silence, let yourself think about something. Or if possible, think about nothing. 
You don’t solve a maze by rushing through. You have to stop and think. You have to walk slowly and carefully, reining in your energy – otherwise you’ll get hopelessly lost. 
You don’t always need a plan. Sometimes you need to breathe, calm down, look around, and improvise. Creativity is the key of life. 
What you do not react to cannot drag you down in a futile engagement. 
When seeking stops, seeker relaxes and stays in his natural state. 
There is peace even in the storm. 
A calm and modest life brings more happiness than the pursuit of success combined with constant restlessness. 
All of humanity’s problems stem from man’s inability to sit quietly in a room alone. 
I will be calm. I will be mistress of myself. 
It takes a calm mind to be able to consider things from different angles and points of view. 
A calm mind makes us relaxed, improves our health and makes for happier families and communities. 
Compassion enhances our self-confidence because a calm mind allows our marvellous human intelligence to bloom. When we’re angry, our thinking is distorted and we don’t see the different aspects of reality. A calm mind enables us to take a broader, more realistic view. 
We don’t realize that, somewhere within us all, there does exist a supreme self who is eternally at peace. 
To a mind that is still, the entire universe surrenders. 
I just feel that there isn’t enough silence, and I’m always asking people if they can just give some silence. 
Today I escaped anxiety. Or no, I discarded it, because it was within me, in my own perceptions — not outside. 
Life isn’t as serious as my mind makes it out to be. 
Unwind, relax, and deepen into the present moment. 
Each one has to find his peace from within. And peace to be real must be unaffected by outside circumstances. 
The most effective way to convince people is quietly. 
Calm is a superpower. 
Still waters run deep. 
Outward action and inner calm. 
Be calm. Be Zen. You are Buddha. 
In the madness, you have to find calm. 
Take it easy, and remember “easy is right.” 
Learn to slow down. Get lost intentionally. 
More patience, more presence, less anxiety. 
Always study to secure your permanent peace. 
Be an island of calm in the sea of craziness. 
Train your mind to be calm in every situation. 
The only thing you control is how you respond. 
You are the sky. Everything else – it’s just the weather. 
In a hyperactive world, stillness is the deepest rebellion. 
If you get the inside right, the outside will fall into place. 
A crust eaten in peace is better than a banquet partaken in anxiety. 
Don’t let people pull you into their storm. Pull them into your peace. 
Remember: we don’t control what happens, we control how we respond. 
Nothing can disturb the calm peace of my soul. 
Do you pay regular visits to yourself? Start now. 
When you keep the peace with yourself, you also bring peace to others. 
Being confident and outspoken is overrated. Being present and calm is underrated. 
Having a calm and compassionate mind enables us to use our natural intelligence more effectively. 
Live intensely, live totally, here and now. Paradise is not some place, somewhere. It is a peace within you. 
The existence loves you, otherwise you would not be here. Relax into your being, you are cherished by the whole. 
When the mind is calm, how quickly, how smoothly, how beautifully you will perceive everything. 
Everything turns on your assumptions about it, and that’s on you. You can pluck out the hasty judgment at will, and like steering a ship around the point, you will find calm seas, fair weather and a safe port. 
Don’t do any task in order to get it over with. Resolve to do each job in a relaxed way, with all your attention. Enjoy and be one with your work. 
There are two things, to be and to do. Don’t think too much about to do – to be is first. To be peace. To be joy. To be happiness. And then to do joy, to do happiness – on the basis of being. 
Everyone at a high level has a huge amount of chess understanding, and much of what separates the great from the very good is deep presence, relaxation of the conscious mind, which allows the unconscious to flow unhindered. 
Before embarking on important undertakings, sit quietly, calm your senses and thoughts, and meditate deeply. You will then be guided by the great creative power of Spirit. 
Be a person on a mission. Move steadily toward your aim. Treat everything else as a distraction. Don’t be sidetracked by things that have no meaning in your life. Let your mission be the highest thing you’re capable of. Let it be the centre around which your life revolves.
The further the reward from the effort, the thinner the competition. Patience is the gatekeeper. 
Our best and most lasting work comes from when we take things slow.

The ideal of calm exists in a sitting cat. 
Always ask yourself: “What will happen if I say nothing?” 
If solitude is the school of genius, then the crowded, busy world is the purgatory of the idiot. 
Be like a duck, paddling and working very hard inside the water, but what everyone sees is a smiling and calm face. 
In dealing with fools you must adopt the following philosophy: they are simply a part of life, like rocks or furniture. 
When working alongside fools, do not fight them. Instead think of them the way you think of children, or pets, not important enough to affect your mental balance. 
Fame and tranquility can never be bedfellows. 
Relax: haters are secret admirers wanting to be you. 
You can’t buy a calm mind, you have to earn it. 
Until we know that death is equal to life, we live in fear. 
Happiness and sadness alike are an assault on equanimity. 
The wise have self-understanding. The wisest have indifference too. 
At any moment, you have a choice, that either leads you closer to your spirit or further away from it. 
The modern mind is overstimulated and the modern body is understimulated and overfed. Meditation, exercise, and fasting restore an ancient balance. 
Doctors won’t make you healthy. Nutritionists won’t make you slim. Teachers won’t make you smart. Gurus won’t make you calm. Mentors won’t make you rich. Trainers won’t make you fit. Ultimately, you have to take responsibility. Save yourself. 
The chaos you see outside is within you. It’s your own projection. When you’re calm from within, you cease to create chaos without. And even if the external chaos is there, it no longer affects you. The world is turbulent if you’re turbulent. It’s calm when you’re calm.
Freedom is only for he who views happiness and sorrow as stray dogs barking in the night. Such a man needs neither self-help or spirituality. He needs neither fortune or blessings. For he lives the sort of life that almost no man can fathom. 
I’m not doing anything, and yet I’m also doing the most important thing a man can do: I’m listening to what I needed to hear from myself. 
The very desire to find shortcuts makes you eminently unsuited for any kind of mastery. 
It is the vice of a vulgar mind to be thrilled by bigness. 
Do not view mountains from the scale of human thought. 
If you want to travel the Way of Buddhas and Zen masters, then expect nothing, seek nothing, and grasp nothing.

When you try to stay on the surface of the water, you sink; but when you try to sink, you float. 
Sitting quietly, doing nothing, spring comes, and the grass grows by itself. 
Only through constant self-awareness and self-knowledge can there be inward tranquillity. 
Once you stop seeking outside what’s already inside, you become free and calm. 
The Master takes action by letting things take their course. He remains as calm at the end as at the beginning. 
It is not wise to rush about. If too much energy is used, exhaustion follows. This is not the way of Tao. 
Best be still; best be empty. In stillness and emptiness we find where to abide. Talking and moving we lose the place. 
Using order to deal with the disorderly, using calm to deal with the clamorous, is mastering the heart. 
There is a simple way to become Buddha: When you refrain from unwholesome actions, are not attached to birth and death, and are compassionate toward all sentient beings, respectful to seniors and kind to juniors, not excluding or desiring anything, with no designing thoughts or worries, you will be called a Buddha. Do not seek anything else. 
The ego gets what it wants with words. The soul finds what it needs in silence. 
Zen is not some special state, it is our normal condition, silent, peaceful, awake, without agitation. 
The beauty of Zen is found in simplicity and tranquility, in a sense of the all-embracing harmony of things. 
Prolong not the past. Invite not the future. Do not alter your innate wakefulness. Fear not appearances. There is nothing more than this. 
The wise speak softly, for their words do not attempt to convince. 
The struggle is great, the task divine — to gain mastery, freedom, happiness, and tranquility. 
When you understand something, then it naturally calms you down. 
The measure of wisdom is how calm you are when facing any given situation. 
Everything is fine until you believe it’s not. 
Don’t be too quick to interpret the moment. Just keep quiet. My encouragement would always be: never think anything is against you, everything is a blessing. Why should it be different? Just be quiet. Let it all work itself out.

A calm and modest life brings more happiness than the pursuit of success combined with constant restlessness. 
Stress is the inability to decide what’s important. 
Stress and confusion come from being busy. Peace and clarity come from slowing down and stilling your waters. 
Stress is caused by being “here” but wanting to be “there”. 
Every once in a while, do you just like to take your time with what you’re doing? 
Today I refuse to stress myself out about things I cannot control or change. 
Our anxiety does not come from thinking about the future, but from wanting to control it. 
The need for certainty is the greatest disease the mind faces. 
Society has sold you the greatest of lies, that the goal of life is to become “happy.” This one chase has cost you your life. 
Almost everything will work again if you unplug it for a few minutes, including you. 
Unease, anxiety, tension, stress, worry – all forms of fear – are caused by too much future, and not enough presence. 
When we get too caught up in the busyness of the world, we lose connection with one another – and ourselves. 
You may have a million desires to be in other places, doing other things, but you are not there, you are here. 
The high value put upon every minute of time, the idea of hurry-hurry as the most important objective of living, is unquestionably the most dangerous enemy of joy. 
The anxiety of worry is almost always worse than the actual consequences. Stop worrying and start doing. 
The solution is often a good dose of indifference. 
Don’t think about the past. Just be here now. Don’t think about the future. Just be here now.

Don’t spin your wheels trying to get everything done. Focus on getting the right things done instead. 
Comfort makes you weaker. We need some variability, some stressors. Not too much, but just enough. 
In a year, 95% of the things that stress you out now you’ll look back and laugh at. The other 5%, you should probably get to work on. 
Life is a series of natural and spontaneous changes. Don’t resist them; that only creates sorrow. 
Stress, anxiety and depression are caused when we are living to please others. 
Daily news and sugar confuse our system in the same manner. 
Our civilization, which is lost in doing, knows nothing of Being. It asks: being? What do you do with it?” 
We get such a kick out of looking forward to pleasures and rushing ahead to meet them that we can’t slow down to enjoy them when they come. 
Stress is not created by the events in your life, but by your reaction to them. 
Only once you give yourself permission to stop trying to do it all, to stop saying yes to everyone, can you make your highest contribution towards the things that really matter. 
The faster and busier things get, the more we need to build thinking time into our schedule. And the noisier things get, the more we need to build quiet reflection spaces in which we can truly focus.

Don’t try to force anything. Let life be a deep let-go. God opens millions of flowers every day without forcing their buds. 
There are two medicines for all ills: time and silence. 
There is more to life than increasing its speed. 
Breathe. Let go. And remind yourself that this very moment is the only one you know you have for sure. 
Within you, there is a stillness and a sanctuary to which you can retreat at any time and be yourself. 
You cannot always control what goes on outside. But you can always control what goes on inside. 
The truth is that there is no actual stress or anxiety in the world; it’s your thoughts that create these false beliefs. You can’t package stress, touch it, or see it. There are only people engaged in stressful thinking. 
If you really want to escape the things that harass you, what you’re needing is not to be in a different place but to be a different person. 
Ignorance is the softest pillow on which a man can rest his head. 
Lack of activity destroys the good condition of every human being.

Your best self can be found based on how you respond to failure. 
You know you’re becoming wise when you care more about what you control and less about what you don’t. 
Every day brings a choice: to practice stress or to practice peace. 
Life is a storm that will test you unceasingly. Don’t wait for calm waters that may not arrive. Derive purpose from resilience. Learn to sail the raging sea.
You are far from the only nervous person in the room. 
When you have a moment, just listen to the beauty of silence. It has so much to say. 
Learn to watch your drama unfold while at the same time knowing you are more than your drama. 
When we stop opposing reality, action becomes simple, fluid, kind, and fearless. 
We should always be asking ourselves: “Is this something that is, or is not, in my control?” 
It is not external events themselves that cause us distress, but the way in which we think about them…It is our attitudes and reactions that give us trouble. We cannot choose our external circumstances, but we can always choose how we respond to them. 
Renew yourself completely every day; do it again, and again, and forever again. 
If you feel lost… sit down, close your eyes, breathe, put your hands on your heart, repeat forever. 
Stress exists only in your mind. Peace exists only in the acceptance of the present moment. 
Let go of what has passed. Let go of what may come. Let go of what is happening now. Don’t try to figure anything out. Don’t try to make anything happen. Relax, right now, and rest. 
When you need to calm down… Breathe in for 5 counts. Hold for 5 counts. Breathe out for 5 counts. Hold for 5 counts. Repeat the cycle 2 more times. 
There are three things you cannot buy. Fitness: You have to keep fit, whether you’re rich or not. Diet: You cannot pay someone to be on a diet for you. Then, looking after your soul. No one can possibly treat your soul but you yourself. 
Observe a stressful thought. Notice how your shoulders tense, your stomach tightens, you hold your breath. Keep watching that same thought. Don’t push it away, instead change your reaction to it. Breathe deeply, let go, relax your body. You’re okay. It’s just a thought. Breathe. 
Stop doing. Start being. It begins with a single thought and a simple statement – I AM. 
Spend a week writing down everything that bothers you. Outrages in the news, personal slights, daily irritations. Read it a month later. How many entries feel important now? Probably not many. Excess reactivity steals happiness and energy. 
Stress and distractions have a mutually reinforcing relationship. They can drive one insane. Slow down, take a deep breath and relax. Pay attention to only one thing at a time. Also, don’t forget to clear mental junk every now and then by meditating for a few minutes. 
If you find yourself mentally exhausted: change your environment. Unclutter your desk. Take a shower. Go for a a walk. Refresh your mental state. 
When you feel overwhelmed, start eliminating all the non-essential things from your life. Clarity brings calm. 
Restore your attention or bring it to a new level by dramatically slowing down whatever you’re doing.

Reality is the leading cause of stress amongst those in touch with it. 
Every kind of fear grows worse by not being looked at. 
When we don’t choose what’s important, everything seems important.

The modern struggle: Lone individuals summoning inhuman willpower, fasting, meditating, and exercising, up against armies of scientists and statisticians weaponizing abundant food, screens, and medicine into junk food, clickbait news, infinite porn, endless games and addictive drugs.

Stress is a state of generalized vulnerability. 
How do you beat your inner turmoil? You can’t beat it, you can only stop creating it. 
The calm person makes a choice. The angry person finds that anger has chosen for them. Rage robs us of reason and makes us puppets of our lower instincts. 
The chief task in life is simply this: to identify and separate matters so that I can say clearly to myself which are externals not under my control, and which have to do with the choices I actually control. 
We see striving everywhere inhibited in many ways, struggling everywhere; and thus always suffering; there is no final goal of striving, and therefore no bounds or end to suffering. 
This world is all attachment. Yet you get worried because you are attached. 
Our real enemy is not man; it’s not another human being. Our real enemy is our ignorance, discrimination, fear, craving, and violence. 
We human beings are what we have been for millions of years – colossally greedy, envious, aggressive, jealous, anxious and despairing, with occasional flashes of joy and affection. 
To discover and transcend craving, which is the deep cause of all conditioning, is arduous and demands constant awareness. 
Much of the stress that people feel doesn’t come from having too much to do. It comes from not finishing what they started. 
Flow with whatever happens and let your mind be free. 
The world is ruled by letting things take their course. 
The river becomes calm when it reaches the ocean. Find your ocean each day. 
Don’t rush. It’s wiser to go slowly in the right direction than fast in the wrong one. 
Feeling irritated, restless, afraid, and hopeless is a reminder to listen more carefully. It’s a reminder to stop talking; watch and listen. 
What you want is to develop a sustainable habit: a stress-free approach to reducing your stress. 
People work out, they stress their body, and their body gets stronger from stress. 
Don’t be blindly ambitious or blindly lazy. Find a balance between mindful action and peaceful inaction. 
Remember that stress doesn’t come from what’s going on in your life. It comes from your thoughts about what’s going on in your life. 
No desires, no goal, no seeking, no thoughts, neither obtaining, nor rejecting, nor grasping, nor letting go, being free. 
Stress happens when something you care about is at stake. It’s not a sign to run away – it’s a sign to step forward. 
In general, obstacles force your mind to focus and find ways around them. They heighten your mental powers and should be welcomed. 
People think peace is positivity, but it’s not. Peace has no opposite, it is a kind of prevailing stillness that is present even in the midst of chaos. Don’t seek positivity. Don’t seek negativity. Accept what is there and find your peace regardless. 
Short-term thinking makes people desperate, ungenerous, impulsive. Long-term thinking makes people calm, gracious, controlled. The mighty pyramids and cathedrals were built by civilizations with a long time horizon, so it is with the life of a great man. 
We all want comfort and fulfillment. But fulfillment demands progress, and progress is uncomfortable. Decide which one is higher on your values list, and be willing to pay the price. 
The most important timeframes: A. 10+ years ahead. B. This moment right now. Worries, small thinking, overplanning – they all happen in-between. And neither justifies leaving the present. 
Being scared isn’t a sign of weakness, it’s a sign something matters. 
The just man is most free from disturbance, while the unjust is full of the utmost disturbance. 
If you understood the nature of your problem, you wouldn’t have one. 
Most of the time, life isn’t an emergency. Much of the time, things will be fine. Save the rush for when it is needed.

Life is not a tension anywhere except in the minds of humanity.

Stop being tormented by everyone else’s reaction to you. 
Never be in a hurry; do everything quietly and in a calm spirit. Do not lose your inner peace for anything whatsoever, even if your whole world seems upset. What is anything in life compared to peace of soul? 
We labour at our daily work more ardently and thoughtlessly than is necessary to sustain our life because it is even more necessary not to have leisure to stop and think. Haste is universal because everyone is in flight from himself.

Don’t worry about achieving. Don’t worry about perfection. Just be there each moment as best you can. 
With my desire to improve everything, I destroy the moment. 
Not being able to govern events, I govern myself. 
It is always possible to practice releasing the tension in yourself. 
Anxiety, the illness of our time, comes primarily from our inability to dwell in the present moment.

Often the moment when we most need to pause is exactly when it feels most intolerable to do so. 
Rather than relaxing and enjoying who we are and what we’re doing, we are comparing ourselves with an ideal and trying to make up for the difference.

When we’re anxious, disconnected, vulnerable, alone, and feeling helpless, the booze and food and work and endless hours online feel like comfort, but in reality they’re only casting their long shadows over our lives.

It did what all ads are supposed to do: create an anxiety relievable by purchase. 
Worrying is carrying tomorrow’s load with today’s strength – carrying two days at once. It is moving into tomorrow ahead of time. Worrying doesn’t empty tomorrow of its sorrow, it empties today of its strength. 
The reason why worry kills more people than work is that more people worry than work. 
The person who trusts can relax into existence. The person who cannot trust remains tense, remains anxious, afraid.

I am an old man and have known a great many troubles, but most of them never happened. 
Nothing is particularly hard if you divide it into small jobs.

You may not control all the events that happen to you, but you can decide not to be reduced by them. 
Our anxiety does not come from thinking about the future, but from wanting to control it. 
Our anxiety does not empty tomorrow of its sorrows, but only empties today of its strengths. 
Why should we be in such desperate haste to succeed and in such desperate enterprises? If a man does not keep pace with his companions, perhaps it is because he hears a different drummer. Let him step to the music he hears, however measured or far away. 
A great many worries can be diminished by realizing the unimportance of the matter which is causing the anxiety. 
Be scared. You can’t help that. But don’t be afraid. 
Who of you by worrying can add a single hour to your life? 
All your anxiety is because of your desire for harmony. Seek disharmony, then you will gain peace.

Trust yourself. You’ve survived a lot, and you’ll survive whatever is coming. 
Always do the things you fear the most. Courage is an acquired taste, like caviar. 
The beauty we long for is already here. 
Lay hold of today’s task, and you will not need to depend so much upon tomorrow’s. 
Today, you can decide to walk in freedom. You can choose to walk differently. You can walk as a free person, enjoying every step. 
When you become comfortable with uncertainty, infinite possibilities open up in your life. It means fear is no longer a dominant factor in what you do and no longer prevents you from taking action to initiate change. 
Excitement and emotion arise when something is not understood. As it is understood, one naturally becomes unfazed. One naturally becomes equanimous. 
Time is a great oppressor. It smothers our spirit. Once you’re free of the pressure of time you can operate in a state of flow where you move intuitively without being disrupted by a tight schedule. This is the fluid, creative state where you’re at ease and function at your peak. 
The mind freed from passions is an impenetrable fortress – a person has no more secure place of refuge for all time. 
Amateurs are scared – scared to be vulnerable and honest with themselves. Professionals feel like they are capable of handling almost anything. 
There is nothing more powerful than releasing the need to control and relying on a power greater than you to restore your thoughts and energy.

You are far from the only nervous person in the room. 
Difficult roads often lead to beautiful destinations. The best is yet to come. 
The truly patient man neither complains of his hard lot nor desires to be pitied by others. He speaks of his sufferings in a natural, true, and sincere way, without murmuring, complaining, or exaggerating them. 
It’s the American obsession to feel happy all the time that makes Americans miserable. Because then you’re upset about being unhappy. And even when you’re happy, you’re worried about when it’ll go away. Thus “The Happiness Trap”. 
The faster and busier things get, the more we need to build thinking time into our schedule. And the noisier things get, the more we need to build quiet reflection spaces in which we can truly focus. 
Cultivate play and rest: let go of exhaustion as a status symbol and productivity as self-worth. 
The ultimate purpose of inquiry is that it allows us to pause. In the space of a pause, truth can shine through.
Use your time, energy and talents to do the best you can right now. Spend no time wishing it were better. 
Everything is fleeting. Why care? Why become emotional about something which is temporary, which you’ll soon forget? Just sit back and observe the transience of everything. You’ll see how you waste your energy on trifles. Most things are just not worth fretting about. 
If you can change your focus, you can change your future. Don’t spend a minute worrying about something that you can’t control. If something can’t be changed by you taking direct action, put it out of your mind. Today’s society is overrun with useless distractions. 
Wherever you are, be there totally. If you find your here and now intolerable and it makes you unhappy, you have three options: remove yourself from the situation, change it, or accept it totally. 
Breath by breath, let go of fear, expectation, anger, regret, cravings, frustration, fatigue. Let go of the need for approval. Let go of old judgments and opinions. Die to all that, and fly free. Soar in the freedom of desirelessness. 
Feelings come and go like clouds in a windy sky. Conscious breathing is my anchor. 
A positive attitude gives you power over your circumstances instead of your circumstances having power over you.

A rational person can find peace by cultivating indifference to things outside of their control.

Of all your troubles, great and small, the greatest are the ones that don’t happen at all. 
There is no trouble so great or grave that cannot be much diminished by a nice cup of tea. 
Relax; the world’s not watching that closely. It’s too busy contemplating itself in the mirror. 
We trouble our life by thoughts about death, and our death by thoughts about life. 
What we seek is some kind of compensation for what we put up with. 
She was terrified of everything, and terrified to show it. 
The level to which we protect ourselves from being vulnerable is a measure of our fear and disconnection. 
Hope is a kind of opium; it keeps you intoxicated. To tolerate the miserable present, your eyes remain fixed on a faraway star: your hope. 
Unresolved thoughts, prematurely pushed out of the mind, pile up in an internal landfill – which eventually pokes out of the subconscious and manifests as chronic, nonspecific anxiety. 
This runaway thinking is just a recipe for anxiety, which is always causing me to try and live forward into the next, into the next, into the next. It’s keeping me moving, moving, moving, and not happy, and not peaceful, and not present. 
What we have to discover is that there is no safety, that seeking it is painful, and that when we imagine we have found it, we don’t like it. 
You look to others for hope and guidance because you are empty and poor; you turn to books, pictures, teachers, gurus and saviours to inspire and strengthen you; you are ever in hunger, ever seeking but never finding. 
Some of us are luckier than others. Some are tough and some are weak. Some are rich and some poor. But no one’s superman – in that way, we’re all weak. If we own things, we’re terrified we’ll lose them; if we’ve got nothing we worry it’ll be that way forever. We’re all the same. 
Do not become upset when difficulty comes your way. Laugh in its face and know that you are in the hands of God. 
Anxiety shows that we are too close to the world and too far from God. 
Prosperity is ever providing itself with anxieties. 
To venture causes anxiety, but not to venture is to lose one’s self… And to venture in the highest is precisely to be conscious of one’s self. 
If you trade your authenticity for safety, you may experience the following: anxiety, depression, eating disorders, addiction, rage, blame, resentment, and inexplicable grief. 
You’re anxious because you avoid anxiety provoking situations. 
You call it hope – that fire of fire! It is but agony of desire. 
Stop worrying about your f*cking future. Start creating it instead. Use your present wisely. And f*ck the past. It’s over. Bury it. 
Anxiety is the dizziness of freedom.

Anxiety is the human condition. It’s probably the single most pervasive emotion. 
Humans aren’t evolved to worry about everything happening outside of their immediate environment. 
Perhaps all anxiety might derive from a fixation on moments — an inability to accept life as ongoing. 
Chasing after the things one yearns for is inferior to chasing after the source of the yearning. 
Short-term thinking makes people desperate, ungenerous, impulsive. Long-term thinking makes people calm, gracious, controlled. The mighty pyramids and cathedrals were built by civilizations with a long time horizon, so it is with the life of a great man. 
Anxiety contaminates the present with the pains of all imaginable futures. We cannot experience the fullness of the moment if we are forever suffering from hypothetical hardships. 
The anxiety many feel is a result of trying to live in the world their imagination created, while being forced to live in the real world. 
Life seems to be a process of replacing one anxiety with another and substituting one desire for another – which is not to say that we should never strive to overcome any of our anxieties or fulfil any of our desires, but rather to suggest that we should perhaps build into our strivings an awareness of the way our goals promise us a respite and a resolution that they cannot, by definition, deliver. 
People think it would be nice to have peace of mind, to be serene, to be calm, to be undisturbed by this, that, and the other. But as long as you make all those things objects of desire, you have defined yourself as lacking them. 
No amount of anxiety can change the future. No amount of regret can change the past. 
Most of us live in a post-scarcity world, yet are still running mental algorithms from a resource scare world. Thus we have anxiety, overconsumption and self-torture. Seeing that truth is the first step to liberation. 
Desire disappears as you become more and more aware. When awareness is one hundred percent, there is no desire at all. 
Remember one thing: except for silence, everything else is your imagination – howsoever beautiful. 
There’s no situation that calls for mild anxiety. Either increase the level of stress to promote action, or forget about it and enjoy life. 
To be in harmony with the wholeness of things is not to have anxiety over imperfections. 
Man is not worried by real problems so much as by his imagined anxieties about real problems. 
A crust eaten in peace is better than a banquet partaken in anxiety. 
One is a great deal less anxious if one feels perfectly free to be anxious. 
Two kinds of happiness. Worldly happiness is reward from our evolutionary program. Get praise, money, drugs, sex. It busies the mind with craving and anxiety. Internal happiness is reward from being in flow. Create, meditate, love, play. It clears the mind and leaves us in peace.

Why should I fear death? If I am, then death is not. If Death is, then I am not. Why should I fear that which can only exist when I do not? 
I’m not afraid of death anymore. And I think a lot of the struggle that we have in life comes from a deep, deep fear of death. And it can take form in many ways. One can be that we want to write the great American novel, or we really want to achieve something in this world, we want to build something, we want to build a great piece of technology or we want to start an amazing business or we want to run for office and make a difference. 
All fears are children of the fear of death. 
It’s not that we fear death, it’s that we fear not living the life we want. 
All men fear death. It’s a natural fear that consumes us all. We fear death because we feel that we haven’t loved well enough or loved at all, which ultimately are one and the same. 
To fear death, gentlemen, is no other than to think oneself wise when one is not, to think one knows what one does not know. No one knows whether death may not be the greatest of all blessings for a man, yet men fear it as if they knew that it is the greatest of evils. 
People fear death even more than pain. It’s strange that they fear death. Life hurts a lot more than death. At the point of death, the pain is over. 
I know it is coming, and I do not fear it, because I believe there is nothing on the other side of death to fear. I hope to be spared as much pain as possible on the approach path. I was perfectly content before I was born, and I think of death as the same state. 
He is terribly afraid of dying because he hasn’t yet lived. 
Live your life that the fear of death can never enter your heart. 
Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate. Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure. It is our light, not our darkness that most frightens us. We ask ourselves, Who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous, talented, and fabulous? Actually, who are you not to be? You are a child of God. Your playing small does not serve the world. There is nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other people will not feel insecure around you. We are all meant to shine, as children do. We were born to make manifest the glory of God that is within us. It is not just in some of us; it is in everyone and as we let our own light shine, we unconsciously give others permission to do the same. As we are liberated from our own fear, our presence automatically liberates others.
I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past, I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain.

Depression is, in part, grief for your own life not turning out how it should; grief for your own needs not being met. 
Love your future more than your past. 
The shadows are as important as the light.
Winter always comes to an end, always. 
Life begins on the other side of despair. 
You can’t stay in your corner of the forest waiting for others to come to you. You have to go to them sometimes. 
Sometimes, when I say “I am ok”, I want someone to hold me tight, look me in the eyes and say “No, I know you are not”. 
There is no normal life that is free of pain. It’s the very wrestling with our problems that can be the impetus for our growth. 
Going through anxiety or depression or any other psychological condition doesn’t make you unlovable – it makes you human. 
Never lose hope. This life is worth the struggle. Your future self is pleading with you to stay. You are more than your thoughts. You are more than your fears and stronger than you give yourself credit for. 
If you are depressed and anxious, the main thing I want to tell you is: your pain makes sense. It has meaning. You aren’t a machine with broken parts. You are a human being with unmet needs. Don’t let anyone tell you you’re crazy or broken. You deserve love and practical support. 
Being deluded and scared will make you suffocate. Being honest with yourself and responsible will make you breathe. 
There will always be suffering. But we must not suffer over the suffering. 
All obstacles that are perceived with love can transform into the greatest life lessons. 
It isn’t that they can’t see the solution. It is that they can’t see the problem. 
The fundamental delusion – there is something out there that will make me happy and fulfilled forever. 
Whereas pain is a physical experience, suffering is a mental one. It is the sense that things should be other than they are. Its antidote is acceptance. 
And once the storm is over, you won’t remember how you made it through, how you managed to survive. You won’t even be sure, whether the storm is really over. But one thing is certain. When you come out of the storm, you won’t be the same person who walked in. 
The wound is the place where the light enters you. 
We cannot simply sit and stare at our wounds forever. We must stand up and move on to the next action. 
It is in dialogue with pain that many beautiful things acquire their value.
There are moments when troubles enter our lives and we can do nothing to avoid them. But they are there for a reason. Only when we have overcome them we will understand why they were there. 
You know quite well, deep within you, that there is only a single magic, a single power, a single salvation…and that is called loving. Well, then, love your suffering. Do not resist it, do not flee from it. It is your aversion that hurts, nothing else. 
Don’t cling to yesterday. It was beautiful, but it was yesterday. 
Depression is a kind of constricted consciousness. 
Depression isn’t a disease; depression is a normal response to abnormal life experiences. 
The opposite of play is not work – the opposite of play is depression. 
What people think causes depression: being weak, being lazy, choosing to think negative. What actually causes depression: a loved one dying, trauma, bullying, low self-esteem, body image issues, financial struggles, genetic factors. 
Depression is a medical condition. We need to create a world where people are as comfortable seeking care for their minds as they are for their bodies. 
Depression is being colorblind and constantly told how colorful the world is. 
Depressed means you need deep rest from the character you’ve been playing in the world. 
Make peace with your past so it won’t destroy your present. 
Step out of the history that is holding you back. Step into the new story you are willing to create. 
With depression, one of the most important things you could realize is that you’re not alone. 
Real change will come about not as a result of prayer, but of using intelligence and taking action. 
I have never felt so much pain in my life. It was tough for me to even get out of bed and I had days when I couldn’t walk, let alone write a rhyme. 
You have to take responsibility for your own happiness. 
You need to know that part of being strong and tough is having the courage to ask for help when you need it. You must not silently suffer. You are all in this together. And, if I may speak personally, we are all in this together because asking for help was one of the best decisions that I have ever made. You will me continually amazed how life changes for the better. 
One of the best things that helps depression is work, and socialising with other people and connecting. Because when you work you find purpose. 
I was hiding out from the celebrity thing, I was smoking way too much dope. I was sitting on the couch and just turning into a doughnut, and I really got irritated with myself. I got to: ‘What’s the point? I know better than this.
Therapy gives you another perspective when you are so lost in your own spiral, it helps. 
I’ve suffered through depression and anxiety my entire life. I just want these kids to know that this modern thing, where everyone is feeling shallow and less connected…that’s not human. 
I think the saddest people always try their hardest to make people happy because they know what it’s like to feel absolutely worthless and they don’t want anyone else to feel like that. 
Depression is the most unpleasant thing I have ever experienced… It is that absence of being able to envisage that you will ever be cheerful again. The absence of hope. That very deadened feeling, which is so very different from feeling sad. Sad hurts but it’s a healthy feeling. It is a necessary thing to feel. Depression is very different. 
I need one of those long hugs where you kinda forget whatever else is happening around you for minute. 
I’ll never forget how the depression and loneliness felt good and bad at the same time. Still does. 
People talk about depression all the time. The difference between depression and sadness is sadness is just from happenstance – whatever happened or didn’t happen for you, or grief, or whatever it is. Depression is your body saying f*ck you, I don’t want to be this character anymore, I don’t want to hold up this avatar that you’ve created in the world. It’s too much for me. 
You can’t stop the future. You can’t rewind the past. 
I struggled with anxiety and depression and questioned whether or not I wanted to be alive anymore. It was when I hit this low that I decided to reach out and ask for the help of a licensed therapist. This decision ultimately helped save my life. You don’t have to wait for things. 
Promise me you’ll always remember: You’re braver than you believe, and stronger than you seem, and smarter than you think. 
Nothing changes if nothing changes. 
Breathe. 
There’s always a solution. 
Reframing is a super power. 
It won’t always be like this. 
I need a break from my own thoughts. 
I’m too tired for long explanations. 
Numb the dark and you numb the light. 
Do not stumble on something behind you. 
Real change requires a desire to change. 
The soul is healed by being with children. 
Today’s hot pain is tomorrow’s cold wisdom. 
To heal a wound you must stop scratching it. 
All of our miseries are nothing but attachment. 
The greatest griefs are those we cause ourselves. 
When you don’t know what you need, you want everything. 
The act of releasing your shame is – in itself – healing.
Only stepping out of old ruts will bring new insights. 
The Universe has your back even when things aren’t working out the way you expected. 
I was blaming instead of taking responsibility. I was taking the easy route that led nowhere instead of taking the hard one that led somewhere. 
Even lost and alone, I kept moving forward. Even scared and confused, I kept moving forward. In the end, that’s what you must do: keep moving forward. 
Some changes look negative on the surface but you will soon realize that space is being created in your life for something new to emerge. 
Go to the place inside that hurts. The part that’s lonely or sad. Your broken heart. Your bruised ego. The part of you that worries it will always be this way. Go there now and silently repeat: May you be happy. May you be safe. May you be filled with love. You’re not alone. 
You’re tired. You’re stressed. You’re mentally and physically drained. You feel alone. Struggling with the present, uncertain of the future. Life sucks right now. You’ll be fine. I promise…It gets better. Just keep moving forward. 
Don’t attack your problems. Face them, confess them, understand what they are. That is the process. 
Nothing has a hold on your mind that you cannot break free of. 
Nobody else can destroy you except you; nobody else can save you except you. 
Reminder – if you feel chronically depressed – try this before you swallow pills: Sunlight, exercise, clean diet, meditation, 8-9 hours of sleep, human interaction. Daily for 2-3 months. There’s a very high chance your depression will get fixed. 
It’s not too late to recover. You’re young, you’re tough. You’re adaptable. You can patch up your wounds, lift up your head and move on.
You got this. One day at a time. You are resilient, courageous, and capable. Be proud of yourself. It isn’t easy enduring depression/anxiety. 
Every day of our lives, we are on the verge of making those slight changes that would make all the difference. 
We can’t take away the suffering of others. What we can do is show up for them. And in doing so, take away the pain of having to suffer alone. 
Offer whatever light you can. 
I’m tired. “Go to sleep then”. No, you don’t understand. 
What not to say to someone with anxiety: quit being dramatic, you need to toughen up, you’re just lazy, when are you going to grow up?, pull yourself together. Try one of these instead: I know this is hard for you, take some time, it’s okay, how can I help? 
Please be aware, I am trying my hardest to push through the pain, the exhaustion and fatigue, the brain fog, the insomnia, the fear, the guilt, the judgement, the relentlessness of it all. All the time. 
Being depressed, all I needed was someone who could listen to me, believe in me, encourage me, but most of all, understand me. 
How to help people struggling with their mental health: Learn about mental health, go to visit them, give practical support, ask other people to help, listen to them, give them a hug, celebrate their small steps. 
Listen. Really, really listen if someone opens up to you about their mental health. A response isn’t always needed, but a compassionate ear is. 
If you have a friend going through a crisis, never say “if I can help, let me know.” It sounds vague, perfunctory. I try to always say: “please tell me what I can do to help: I want to help you.” Friendship is a commitment: always show up in a crisis. 
With the right help, we can understand these problems and we can fix these problems together. But to do that, the very first step is we have to stop insulting these signals by saying they’re a sign of weakness, or madness or purely biological, except for a tiny number of people. 
If you know someone who’s depressed, please resolve never to ask them why. Depression isn’t a straightforward response to a bad situation; depression just is, like the weather. 
It’s okay to not be okay all the time. 
If you think you are alone in your problems, you are not alone. There are 7 billion people out there. Someone is going through the same thing. 
Go on that journey to discover who you really are, what you love, what you hate, what’s the content of your mind, why you are the way you are. Be curious about your own mind, your fears and your sadness. Meditate and take care of yourself. The more self-knowledge you’ll have, the better you’ll feel. 
The people who have already walked through the fire can help you do the same. 
Many, many men have been just as troubled morally and spiritually as you are right now. Happily, some of them kept records of their troubles. You’ll learn from them – if you want to. 
Do not get lost in a sea of despair. Do not become bitter or hostile. Be hopeful, be optimistic. 
If you are depressed or anxious – your pain makes sense. You’re not crazy. You’re not broken. There’s scientific evidence for why people feel this way. There’s a mix of causes – biological, psychological and social. None are your fault and all can be dealt with, with love and support. 
No matter how bad things are right now, no matter how stuck you feel, no matter how many days you’ve spent crying and wishing things were different, no matter how hopeless and depressed you feel, I promise you that you won’t feel this way forever. Keep going. 
This is one more piece of advice I have for you: don’t get impatient. Even if things are so tangled up you can’t do anything, don’t get desperate or blow a fuse and start yanking on one particular thread before it’s ready to come undone. You have to figure it’s going to be a long process and that you’ll work on things slowly, one at a time. 
If you run away from pain without identifying and solving the underlying issue, you will probably run to exactly the same situation again. 
I believe depression is legitimate. But I also believe that if you don’t: exercise, eat nutritious foods, get sunlight, get enough sleep, consume positive material, surround yourself with support, then you aren’t giving yourself a fighting chance. 
When something is too close to your eyes you cannot see it. For seeing, some distance is needed. 
Love is the most healing force in the world; nothing goes deeper than love. It heals not only the body, not only the mind, but also the soul. If one can love then all one’s wounds disappear. Then one becomes whole – and to be whole is to be holy. 
I was only able to start changing my life when I realized my depression was not a malfunction. It’s a signal. Your depression is a signal. It’s telling you something. 
The scientific evidence is clear that exercise significantly reduces depression and anxiety. 
The more you think life is about money, and status, and how you look to other people, the more vulnerable you are to depression and anxiety. Just like junk food has taken over our diets, junk values have taken over our minds and made us sick. 
It’s okay to worry; it’s okay to be sad. It’s okay to get scared; it’s okay to be mad. It’s okay to embrace our humanity. In fact we don’t have any choice but to be the sensitive, vulnerable creatures we were made to be. Breathe. Let go a bit. It’s okay to be you just as you are. 
In meditation we learn that sitting is enough. Breathing is enough. This life is enough. And we’re enough too. 
What if we weren’t so hurried to find the answers? What if it was safe to hang out in the unknown? To stumble around in the dark, curious as to what we might find, comfortable in not having it all sorted out. What would we discover about ourselves? About each other? About life? 
If you are being gentle with yourself during a difficult time, that is not self-pity. You would show compassion to a friend in pain, even a stranger, so why withhold it from yourself? Don’t. Keep moving. 
For anyone struggling or battling through mental and chronic illness, please please remember that you are so brave even though you might not think it. You are literally fighting for your life, fighting through pain and fighting to get through each day, which makes you so fricking strong. 
Things to remember: it’s okay to cry, it’s okay to ask for help, you are enough, you matter, bad days happen, you are not alone. 
In case no one told you today, you are needed, you are stronger than you think, you are doing great, you deserve the best, you are here for a reason, don’t give up. 
Before you diagnose yourself with depression or low self-esteem, first make sure that you are not, in fact, just surrounded by assholes. 
Take your M.E.D.S.: MEDITATION – It’s easy to be constantly doing with no time to be. EXERCISE – Our body needs to be stretched. It’s a use it or lose it. DIET – Food for energy which builds and augments rather than destroys. SLEEP – Get the correct amount, feel great. 
Some lessons can’t be taught, they simply have to be learned. 
Take your life in your own hands, and what happens? A terrible thing: no one to blame. 
I am always with myself, and it is I who am my tormentor. 
Being depressed is an opportunity to make a new beginning and to take a new direction. Once you accept the fact that for now, you’re stalled and lost, then you can take the first step. 
You can’t control what happens to you but you can control how you react and the direction you’ll take. 
We’re the middle children of history, man. No purpose or place. We have no Great War. No Great Depression. Our Great War’s a spiritual war… our Great Depression is our lives. We’ve all been raised on television to believe that one day we’d all be millionaires, and movie gods, and rock stars. But we won’t. And we’re slowly learning that fact. And we’re very, very pissed off. 
Every thought a person dwells upon, whether he expresses it or not, either damages or improves his life. 
Man suffers only because he takes seriously what the gods made for fun. 
Much misery comes from our current self not wanting to betray our past self. 
Suffering is an indication of ignorance, but in seeking an escape from suffering you are only nourishing ignorance. 
We are always trying to build a bridge between ‘what is’ and ‘what should be’. And in that there is contradiction and conflict. 
We are downtrodden by society, by culture, by religions, by priests, by leaders, by saints, and unless you understand this you will never understand fear. 
When you’re ready to wake up, you’re going to wake up. And if you’re not ready, you’re going to stay pretending you’re just “poor little me”. 
Most symptoms of depression and anxiety are due to: GMO food, no exercise, sitting all day, disconnect with nature, gossiping, no ambition, lack of sunlight, toxic relationships, victimhood mentality, pleasure seeking. There’s no medication to cure this. 
Stop looking for happiness in the same place you lost it. 
There are real brain changes that can happen when you become depressed that can make it harder to get out. 
Many depressed people can only see their pains, and their hurts, and their resentments, and their failures. They can’t see the blue sky and the yellow leaves, you know? 
Depression is more than emotion it’s: trouble concentrating and making decisions, constant negative thoughts, fatigue and body aches, irritability and restlessness, feeling empty, loss of interest in everything. 
Man is sometimes extraordinarily, passionately, in love with suffering. 
Suffering is not holding you; you are holding suffering. 
Frustrations come because we impose our illusions on reality. 
In the flame of awareness all problems are finally resolved. 
Despair can never be dissolved through escape, but by observing it. 
Depression is a gift. The only inconvenient is that you need to wait a few weeks, and sometimes a few years, to appreciate it. Be patient. 
Ordinarily we do not discover the wisdom of our feelings because we do not let them complete their work. We try to suppress them or discharge them in premature action. Not realizing that they are a process of creation which, like birth, begins as a pain and turns into a child. 
We must abandon completely the notion of blaming the past for any kind of situation we’re in. 
The greatest wisdom lies on the other side, immediately on the other side, of the greatest despair. 
Buddha’s doctrine: man suffers because of his craving to possess and keep forever things which are impermanent. 
If you are depressed, you live in the past. If you are anxious, you live in the future. But if you are at peace, you live in the present. 
Life will give you whatever experience is the most helpful for the evolution of your consciousness. How do you know this is the experience you need? Because this is the experience you are having at this moment. 
The faster you accept reality, the faster you find peace of mind. 
Our wounds need nurturing care in order to heal. If we are to nurture and heal, we must admit that the wounds exist. 
Meditation can and will order your thinking and therefore your mind. As we heal the wounded places in our minds, we grow. 
Resistance to unwanted circumstances has the power to keep those circumstances alive and well for a very long time. 
Difficult events occur for our spiritual growth. These aren’t meant to be punishment. Beautiful sunset awaits after heavy rain. 
When you do not get to the root of the problem, you cannot solve it in any meaningful manner. 
Not all storms come to disturb your life. Some come to clear your path. 
Stop texting, start listening. 
Comparing yourself to others is a guaranteed prescription for misery. 
To anyone feeling depressed and anxious: Fastest way to feel better is to get offline. 
No amount of social media will replace a hug, an handshake and a real look in the eyes. 
Put down your phone. Talk to someone face to face. We are all kinder out here in the meat-world. 
The scrutiny that young people face on social media can lead to anxiety, depression, and even suicidal thoughts. 
Why are depression and anxiety on the rise? Because modern society is designed to make you anxious and depressed. Garbage food, sedentary lifestyle, cubicle work, social media, toxic politics, hookup culture, loss of religion, decline of family, drugs, consumerism. 
The Internet was born into a world where many people had already lost their sense of connection to each other. The collapse had already been taking place for decades by then. The web arrived offering them a kind of parody of what they were losing – Facebook friends in place of neighbors, video games in place of meaningful work, status updates in place of status in the world. 
Facebook is virtual prison which keeps dead relationships alive forever. 
I am your addiction. Your time is mine. I control you. You need me. I define you. You belong to me. -Social Media. 
The rise of social media is proving problematic. Younger age groups of children and adults are now becoming heavily absorbed in it, unaware that social media presents rose-tinted versions of life as the truth, and it’s against this fiction that they’re comparing themselves. 
We have a whole range of devices and apps designed to be addictive. Build mental firewalls so that you can focus on what’s important. Learn to control environmental stimuli. Don’t lose the attention war. 
Since time began people: Got married, ate meat, raised families, spoke face to face, confronted issues. For 60 years people have: Had casual relationships, ate fried carbs, lived alone, spoke through screens, buried problems. A millennia of behaviours cant be wrong. 
As kids become more depressed and anxious, limiting screen time is not enough. Kids need less homework and fewer tests, longer recesses and lunches, more socioemotional learning, more unstructured, unscheduled time to play. 
Toxins consumed by people on a daily basis: sugar, vegetable oils, TV, excessive/indiscriminate social media, “socialization”, hurriedness, political and celebrity gossip, news, “friends”, social approval/validation. 
One lesson from the success of podcasts and YouTube: there is an enormous market for digital companionship. We are profoundly social creatures. Modern life can be lonely. We miss the chatter of the ancestral campfire. We import voices to fill the silence and feel less isolated.
When you access social media, email, or the news, you enable the voices of all of humanity to compete to set your agenda. These voices take up significant mental real estate. They make it hard to hear your own thinking. Be vigilant about guarding your own cognitive resources.
Modern tech and media tempt us to spend our lives reacting to things we can’t change. Obsessing over far-off dramas, ignoring the decline close to home. Smartphones offer 24/7 access to on demand anxiety. Make your tools serve you. Don’t serve them. Act more. React less. 
People worry constantly about their place in their tribe. They find it hard enough to manage the opinions of a few friends and family. Managing the visible opinions of thousands? Impossible. Social media made everyone a micro celebrity and sent “social anxiety” through the roof. 
Part 1. Mobile phones should be called distraction machines. Checking your distraction machine first thing in the morning is not the ideal way to start your day. 
Part 2. Entertainment hubs masquerading as productivity devices – the perfect combo. 
The comedian Marc Maron once wrote that “every status update is a just a variation on a single request: ‘Would someone please acknowledge me?” 
When they talk among themselves, advertising people have been admitting since the 1920s that their job is to make people feel inadequate – and then offer their product as the solution to the sense of inadequacy they have created. 
It is no measure of health to be well adjusted to a profoundly sick society. 
It will be fine, I promise. It just takes time, hope and work. Friends and support: express yourself more to the ones you love. Simplicity: take baby steps, do one thing at a time, don’t chew too much. Exercise and walking: move at least 2-3 times a week. You can’t have a healthy mind if you don’t have a healthy body. Nature, sun: spend more time in nature and get your Vitamin D. Diet: more water, more quality food, more good fats (extra virgin olive oil), more Omega 3, less sugar, less junk, less alcohol, less caffeine. Sleep: get at least 7 hours, have a peaceful/quiet, cool and dark room, go to bed at the same time every day. Relaxation: listen to soothing music, take hot baths/saunas/spas. Consume less junk: less social media, less news, less screens, less toxic relationships, less useless things to do, less things you hate to do. Create more: it feels good to create and build things. Stoic philosophy: read some Stoic quotes. Don’t try to control what you can’t (almost anything in life basically). Try to control what you can (how you react, what you do, your perception, your effort). Don’t dwell on the past: there’s nothing you can do about it. Don’t fear the future: it’s not here yet. Gratitude: there are still many things you can be grateful for. List them. Think about them before you go to bed and first thing in the morning. Overcoming depression takes time, be patient. There are no shortcuts, no overnight change. It will be fine in the end. 
This pain you are feeling is not a pathology. It’s not crazy. It is a signal that your natural psychological needs are not being met. It is a form of grief – for yourself, and for the culture you live in going so wrong. I know how much it hurts. I know how deeply it cuts you. But you need to listen to this signal. We all need to listen to the people around us sending out this signal. It is telling you what is going wrong. It is telling you that you need to be connected in so many deep and stirring ways that you aren’t yet – but you can be, one day.
The word ‘depressed’ can be spoken as DEEP REST. We can choose to view depression, not as a mental illness but as a state of Deep Rest, a spiritual exhaustion that we enter into when we are depressed (pressed down) by the weight of the false self, the mask, the mind-made story of “me”. We long to stop pretending, and express our raw truth! To give voice to our secret loneliness, our shame, our broken hearts, boredom, and brilliant rage! Depression’s call to truth needs to be listened to and understood, not analyzed or medicated away. There is no shame in your exhaustion. We are all exhausted, my love. Slow down today. Allow yourself to rest, deeply. And weep. And breathe. And begin again. Now. I say, our depression is holy. It contains the seeds of new life.
Find meaning. Distinguish melancholy from sadness. Go out for a walk. It doesn’t have to be a romantic walk in the park, spring at its most spectacular moment, flowers and smells and outstanding poetical imagery smoothly transferring you into another world. It doesn’t have to be a walk during which you’ll have multiple life epiphanies and discover meanings no other brain ever managed to encounter. Do not be afraid of spending quality time by yourself. Find meaning or don’t find meaning but ‘steal’ some time and give it freely and exclusively to your own self. Opt for privacy and solitude. That doesn’t make you antisocial or cause you to reject the rest of the world. But you need to breathe. And you need to be.

Sit with the pain until it passes, and you will be calmer for the next one. 
Without pain, without sacrifice, we would have nothing. 
Let go of the past. 
Adversity is the first path to truth. 
Great things never came from comfort zones. 
Although the world is full of suffering, it is full also of the overcoming of it. 
It is always by way of pain one arrives at pleasure. 
True self-discovery begins where your comfort zone ends. 
One word frees us of all the weight and pain of life: that word is love. 
Be patient and tough; someday this pain will be useful to you. 
Turn your wounds into wisdom. 
New beginnings are often disguised as painful endings. 
If you are distressed by anything external, the pain is not due to the thing itself, but to your estimate of it; and this you have the power to revoke at any moment.
You never know how strong you are until being strong is your only choice
Every pain is a gift. Every pain is an opportunity.
The root of all suffering is attachment.
What hurts us is what heals us.
I can bear any pain as long as it has meaning
Change happens when the pain of staying the same is greater than the pain of change.
Out of suffering have emerged the strongest souls; the most massive characters are seared with scars.
People go through so much pain trying to avoid pain.
Too many people believe that everything must be pleasurable in life, which makes them constantly search for distractions and short-circuits the learning process.
Most of the gains in life come from suffering in the short term, so you can get paid in the long term.
Pain makes me grow. Growing is what I want. Therefore, for me pain is pleasure.
Life begins at the end of your comfort zone. 
It is when I struggle that I strengthen. It is when challenged to my core that I learn the depth of who I am. 
God whispers to us in our pleasures, speaks in our conscience, but shouts in our pains: it is his megaphone to rouse a deaf world. 
Humility, after the first shock, is a cheerful virtue
Be master of your petty annoyances and conserve your energies for the big, worthwhile things. It isn’t the mountain ahead that wears you out – it’s the grain of sand in your shoe.
The real man smiles in trouble, gathers strength from distress, and grows brave by reflection.
The pain will leave once it has finished teaching you.
I’ve learned more from pain than I could’ve ever learned from pleasure.
Remember anything you want that’s valuable requires you to break through short-term pain in order to gain long-term pleasure.
Failure gave me strength. Pain was my motivation. 
Pain nourishes courage. You can’t be brave if you’ve only had wonderful things happen to you. 
You must go through that short-term pain to reach long-term gains. A meaningful life is about growth, not comfort. 
We do survive every moment, after all, except the last one.
The aim of the wise is not to secure pleasure but to avoid pain. 
We must embrace pain and burn it as fuel for our journey.
You may have had unfair things happen to you, but the depth of your pain is an indication of the height of your future
There is no education like adversity.
Behind every beautiful thing, there’s been some kind of pain.
If you’re going through hell, keep going.
We must all suffer from one of two pains: the pain of discipline or the pain of regret. The difference is discipline weighs ounces while regret weighs tons.
Laugher is the tonic, the relief, the surcease for pain.
The only thing that’s the end of the world is the end of the world.
It is easier to find men who will volunteer to die, than to find those who are willing to endure pain with patience.
Don’t cry because it’s over, smile because it happened.
Nothing pains some people more than having to think.
Let me embrace thee, sour adversity, for wise men say it is the wisest course.
There is a saying in Tibetan, ‘Tragedy should be utilized as a source of strength’. No matter what sort of difficulties, how painful experience is, if we lose our hope, that’s our real disaster.
One thing you can’t hide – is when you’re crippled inside.
Life is pain, so live it up while you can.
There are no gains without pains.
Smile, though your heart is aching. Smile, even though it’s breaking. When there are clouds in the sky, you’ll get by if you smile through your pain and sorrow. Smile and maybe tomorrow, you’ll see the sun come shining through for you.
It is only through labor and painful effort, by grim energy and resolute courage, that we move on to better things.
There is no greater agony than bearing an untold story inside you.
My pain may be the reason for somebody’s laugh. But my laugh must never be the reason for somebody’s pain.

It is human to have your soul brought to a crisis you did not anticipate.
This aspect of reality, this weird scary aspect of life, can just wreck everything if you don’t figure out at some point that it is what makes life so profound, meaningful, rich, complex, wild.

Success is failure recycled. Life is death reborn.
The world would be dramatically better if everyone had to experience a near death event growing up. Everyone will instantly value their time more, and be happier.
Everything is ridiculous if one thinks of death.
Take nothing for granted. Keep in mind that it can come at anytime. Even today.
It seems to me that if you or I must choose between two courses of thought or action, we should remember our dying and try so to live that our death brings no pleasure to the world.
I despise wisdom and the blessings of this world. It is all worthless, fleeting, illusory, and deceptive, like a mirage. 
You may be proud, wise, and fine, but death will wipe you off the face of the earth as though you were no more than mice burrowing under the floor, and your posterity, your history, your immortal geniuses will burn or freeze together with the earthly globe.
Death is the true inspiring genius, or the muse of philosophy… Indeed without death men would scarcely philosophize.
Too many people are thinking of security instead of opportunity. They seem to be more afraid of life than death.
Death is a stripping away of all that is not you. The secret of life is to “die before you die” – and find that there is no death.
In the end one needs more courage to live than to kill himself.
Men are never really willing to die except for the sake of freedom: therefore they do not believe in dying completely.
If you gave someone your heart and they died, did they take it with them? Did you spend the rest of forever with a hole inside you that couldn’t be filled?

The idea of a good society is something you do not need a religion and eternal punishment to buttress; you need a religion if you are terrified of death.
I have wrestled with death. It is the most unexciting contest you can imagine. It takes place in an impalpable greyness, with nothing underfoot, with nothing around, without spectators, without clamour, without glory, without the great desire of victory, without the great fear of defeat, in a sickly atmosphere of tepid skepticism, without much belief in your own right, and still less in that of your adversary.
Absolute silence leads to sadness. It is the image of death.
Sing your death song, and die like a hero going home.

We owe respect to the living; to the dead we owe only truth.
The harder the pain, the longer the path to recovery, the better the opportunity to learn.
Death: something like birth, a natural mystery, elements that split and recombine. Not an embarrassing thing. Not an offense to reason, or our nature.
All good is hard. All evil is easy. Dying, losing, cheating, and mediocrity is easy. Stay away from easy.
I could just remember how my father used to say that the reason for living was to get ready to stay dead a long time.
What is history? Its beginning is that of the centuries of systematic work devoted to the solution of the enigma of death, so that death itself may eventually be overcome. That is why people write symphonies, and why they discover mathematical infinity and electromagnetic waves.
For life be, after all, only a waitin’ for somethin’ else than what we’re doin’; and death be all that we can rightly depend on.
Losing your life is not the worst thing that can happen. The worst thing is to lose your reason for living.
Life is so beautiful that death has fallen in love with it, a jealous, possessive love that grabs at what it can. But life leaps over oblivion lightly, losing only a thing or two of no importance, and gloom is just a passing shadow of a cloud.
Love never dies a natural death. It dies because we don’t know how to replenish its source. It dies of blindness and errors and betrayals. It dies of illness and wounds; it dies of weariness, of witherings, of tarnishings.
Death destroys a man: the idea of Death saves him.
Die happily and look forward to taking up a new and better form. Like the sun, only when you set in the west can you rise in the east.
That’s what literature is. It’s the people who went before us, tapping out messages from the past, from beyond the grave, trying to tell us about life and death! Listen to them!
When people don’t express themselves, they die one piece at a time.
Life is for the living. Death is for the dead. Let life be like music. And death a note unsaid.
Give place to others, as others have given place to you. Equality is the soul of equity. Who can complain of being comprehended in the same destiny, wherein all are involved?
It is the fate — the genetic and neural fate — of every human being to be a unique individual, to find his own path, to live his own life, to die his own death.
Man always thinks about the past before he dies, as if he were frantically searching for proof that he truly lived.
It is said that your life flashes before your eyes just before you die. That is true, it’s called Life.
Do not seek death. Death will find you. But seek the road which makes death a fulfillment.
Since we’re all going to die, it’s obvious that when and how don’t matter.
Death smiles at us all, all a man can do is smile back.
It is as natural to die as it is to be born.
There is love in holding and there is love in letting go.
These births and deaths are changes in nature which we are mistaking for changes in us.
It is necessary to be strong in the face of death, because death is intrinsic to life. It is for this reason that I tell my students: aim to be the person at your father’s funeral that everyone, in their grief and misery, can rely on. There’s a worthy and noble ambition: strength in the face of adversity.
Dying is a very dull, dreary affair. And my advice to you is to have nothing whatever to do with it.
And as long as you’re subject to birth and death, you’ll never attain enlightenment.
Do you see the gift that you had? Do you see how lucky you were?
There is no birth, there is no death; there is no coming, there is no going; there is no same, there is no different; there is no permanent self, there is no annihilation. We only think there is.
Everyone we cherish will, someday, get sick and die. If we do not practice the meditation on emptiness, when those things happen, we will be overwhelmed. Concentration on emptiness is a way of staying in touch with life as it is, but it has to be practiced, not just talked about.
Happiness can exist only in acceptance.
Once you accept your own death, all of a sudden you’re free to live. You no longer care about your reputation. You no longer care except so far as your life can be used tactically to promote a cause you believe in.
We must constantly remind ourselves that we are eternity, infinite, beyond birth and death.
Everyone wants to be foremost in this future-and yet death and the stillness of death are the only things certain and common to all in this future! How strange that this sole thing that is certain and common to all, exercises almost no influence on men, and that they are the furthest from regarding themselves as the brotherhood of death! It makes me happy to see that men do not want to think at all of the idea of death! I would fain do something to make the idea of life to us to be more than friends in the sense of that sublime possibility. And so we will believe in our even a hundred times more worthy of their attention.
For after all, the best thing one can do when it is raining is let it rain.

Preparing for death is one of the most empowering things you can do. Thinking about death clarifies your life.
The first step toward change is awareness. The second step is acceptance.
Without birth and death, and without the perpetual transmutation of all the forms of life, the world would be static, rhythm-less, undancing, mummified.
Every man must do two things alone; he must do his own believing and his own dying.
If you are mindful of death, it will not come as a surprise-you will not be anxious. You will feel that death is merely like changing clothes. Consequently, at that point you will be able to maintain your calmness of mind.
To be fully alive, fully human, and completely awake is to be continually thrown out of the nest. To live fully is to be always in no-man’s-land, to experience each moment as completely new and fresh. To live is to be willing to die over and over again.
Our life and death are the same thing. When we realize this fact we have no fear of death anymore, and we have no actual difficulty in our life.
When someone we love dies, we get so busy mourning what died that we ignore what didn’t.
My happiness grows in direct proportion to my acceptance, and in inverse proportion to my expectations.
The more you know who you are, and what you want, the less you let things upset you.
Death is life’s high meed.
Now, of all the benefits that virtue confers upon us, the contempt of death is one of the greatest, as the means that accommodates human life with a soft and easy tranquillity, and gives us a pure and pleasant taste of living, without which all other pleasure would be extinct.
We should always, as near as we can, be booted and spurred, and ready to go, and, above all things, take care, at that time, to have no business with any one but one’s self. Why for so short a life tease ourselves with so many projects?
Death is our friend precisely because it brings us into absolute and passionate presence with all that is here, that is natural, that is love…
One should die proudly when it is no longer possible to live proudly.

Our culture’s zeal for longevity reveals our incredible collective fear of death.
I do not believe that any man fears to be dead, but only the stroke of death.
Some people are so afraid to die that they never begin to live.
Suppose that a god announced that you were going to die tomorrow “or the day after”. Unless you were a complete coward you wouldn’t kick up a fuss about which day it was – what difference could it make? Now recognize that the difference between years from now and tomorrow is just as small.
Don’t look down on death, but welcome it. It to is one of the things required by nature. Like youth and old age. Like growth and maturity. Like a new set of teeth, a beard, the first gray hair. Like sex and pregnancy and childbirth. Like all the other physical changes at each stage of life, our dissolutions is no different.
The more you transform your life from the material to the spiritual domain, the less you become afraid of death. A person who lives a truly spiritual life has no fear of death.
You know, what’s so dreadful about dying is that you are completely on your own.
Not only are selves conditional but they die. Each day, we wake slightly altered, and the person we were yesterday is dead. So why, one could say, be afraid of death, when death comes all the time?
Be sure the safest rule is that we should not dare to live in any scene in which we dare not die. But, once realise what the true object is in life — that it is not pleasure, not knowledge, not even fame itself, ‘that last infirmity of noble minds’ — but that it is the development of character, the rising to a higher, nobler, purer standard, the building-up of the perfect Man — and then, so long as we feel that this is going on, and will (we trust) go on for evermore, death has for us no terror; it is not a shadow, but a light; not an end, but a beginning!
Guilt is perhaps the most painful companion to death.
I believe that fear of life brings a greater fear of death.
The typical human behaviour is to seek security and certainty. We fear death because it’s the unknown and nobody can give us answers.
Death anxiety is greater in those who feel they have lived an unfulfilled life.

The bitterest tears shed over graves are for words left unsaid and deeds left undone.
Dying is like coming to the end of a long novel – you only regret it if the ride was enjoyable and left you wanting more.
Many of us crucify ourselves between two thieves – regret for the past and fear of the future.
Life will undertake to separate us, and we must each set off in search of our own path, our own destiny or our own way of facing death.
People die all the time. Life is a lot more fragile than we think. So you should treat others in a way that leaves no regrets. Fairly, and if possible, sincerely. It’s too easy not to make the effort, then weep and wring your hands after the person dies.
If I can see pain in your eyes, then share with me your tears. If I can see joy in your eyes, then share with me your smile.
I think death is equally terrible for everyone. Young people, old people, the good, the bad; it’s always the same. It’s rather fair in its treatment. There’s no such thing as a terrible death, that’s why it’s frightening.
Do not seek death. But do not fear it either. There cannot be life without death, it is inescapable.
It is the unknown we fear when we look upon death and darkness, nothing more.
When it’s time to die, let us not discover that we have never lived.
Live your life that the fear of death can never enter your heart.
Death in itself is nothing; but we fear to be we know not what, we know not where.
Isn’t it sad that so often it takes facing death to appreciate life and each other fully?
You are facing death and danger and competition, but at any moment, you can decide to have a fearless mindset.
To fear death is nothing other than to think oneself wise when one is not. For it is to think one knows what one does not know. No one knows whether death may not even turn out to be the greatest blessings of human beings. And yet people fear it as if they knew for certain it is the greatest evil.
Man alone chimes the hour. And, because of this, man alone suffers a paralyzing fear that no other creature endures. A fear of time running out.
Each day, we wake slightly altered, and the person we were yesterday is dead. So why, one could say, be afraid of death, when death comes all the time?
The funny thing about facing imminent death is that it really snaps everything else into perspective.
Let us not pray to be sheltered from dangers but to be fearless when facing them.
Let thy hope of heaven master thy fear of death.
There is an afterlife. I am convinced of this.
I have always imagined that paradise will be a kind of library.
I regret not death. I am going to meet my friends in another world.
Whether or not there’s an afterlife, screw it. Just live your life right here, right now before it’s too late.
If we can prove an afterlife, then we have less pressure to make our physical life last forever.
I would love to believe that when I die I will live again, that some thinking, feeling, remembering part of me will continue. But as much as I want to believe that, and despite the ancient and worldwide cultural traditions that assert an afterlife, I know of nothing to suggest that it is more than wishful thinking.
The real question of life after death isn’t whether or not it exists, but even if it does what problem this really solves.
We sometimes congratulate ourselves at the moment of waking from a troubled dream; it may be so the moment after death.
Birth is not a beginning; death is not an end. There is existence without limitation; there is continuity without a starting point.
You are dead – what am I speaking to?
There is no death. Only a change of worlds.
Death is the greatest illusion of all.
Death is as sure for that which is born, as birth for that which is dead. Therefore grieve not for what is inevitable.
The strongest intimidation, by the way, is the invention of a hereafter with a hell everlasting.
I don’t like paradise, as they probably don’t have obsessions there.
I don’t believe in an afterlife, so I don’t have to spend my whole life fearing hell, or fearing heaven even more. For whatever the tortures of hell, I think the boredom of heaven would be even worse.
Ancient Egyptians believed that upon death they would be asked two questions and their answers would determine whether they could continue their journey in the afterlife. The first question was, ‘Did you bring joy?’ The second was, ‘Did you find joy?
I regard the brain as a computer which will stop working when its components fail. There is no heaven or afterlife for broken down computers; that is a fairy story for people afraid of the dark.
Of course you don’t die. Nobody dies. Death doesn’t exist. You only reach a new level of vision, a new realm of consciousness, a new unknown world.
There is no conclusive evidence of life after death, but there is no evidence of any sort against it. Soon enough you will know, so why fret about it?
From my rotting body, flowers shall grow and I am in them and that is eternity.
Endings are not always bad. Most times they’re just beginnings in disguise.
Death – the last sleep? No, it is the final awakening.
I cannot pretend I am without fear. But my predominant feeling is one of gratitude. I have loved and been loved; I have been given much and I have given something in return; I have read and traveled and thought and written. I have had an intercourse with the world, the special intercourse of writers and readers. Above all, I have been a sentient being, a thinking animal, on this beautiful planet, and that in itself has been an enormous privilege and adventure. 
The most important thing to arrive on your deathbed satisfied and grateful is to first live your life fully.
How lucky I am to have something that makes saying goodbye so hard.
Death comes to all, but great achievements build a monument which shall endure until the sun grows cold.

We feel guilt when we no longer want to associate with old friends and colleagues who haven’t changed. The price, and marker, of growth.
Part 1. We’re used to constantly judging things. The act of judging something separates you from that thing.
Part 2. Over time, as you judge, judge, judge, you invariably judge people. You judge yourself. You separate yourself from everything, and then you end up lonely.
Part 3. That feeling of disconnection, loneliness, is eventually what leads to suffering.
Be strong enough to stand alone, smart enough to know when you need help, and brave enough to ask for it.

I can’t take away your pain, but I can offer you two miracles: the love that comes from turning toward other human beings, and the connection we have to everyone on Earth.
What I must do is all that concerns me, not what the people think. This rule, equally arduous in actual and intellectual life, may serve for the whole distinction between greatness and meanness. It is the harder, because you will always find those who think they know what is your duty better than you know it. It is easy in the world to live after the world’s opinion; it is easy in solitude to live after our own; but the great person is one who in the midst of the crowd keeps with perfect sweetness the independence of solitude.
Is it so bad then to be misunderstood? Pythagoras was misunderstood, and Socrates, and Jesus, and Luther, and Copernicus, and Galileo, and Newton, and every pure and wise spirit that ever took flesh. To be great is to be misunderstood.

A man is born alone and dies alone, and he experiences the good and bad consequences of his karma alone, and he goes alone to hell or the Supreme abode.
If you want to live a miserable life, then blame everyone for your problems and never take responsibility for anything.
Don’t live in a manner that makes you despise being alone with yourself.
People fear the places the undistracted mind might wander too. Much of what people describe as boredom is in fact a fear of stillness. Distraction lets us fill our minds with other voices so we don’t have to listen to the inner voice that whispers truths we fear to confront.
If a man cannot understand the beauty of life, it is probably because life never understood the beauty in him.
Isn’t it funny that at Christmas something in you gets so lonely for – I don’t know what exactly, but it’s something that you don’t mind so much not having at other times.
The loneliest moment in someone’s life is when they are watching their whole world fall apart, and all they can do is stare blankly.
Being alone never felt right. Sometimes it felt good, but it never felt right.
The price for independence is often isolation and solitude.
To find yourself, think for yourself.
Loneliness is a tax we have to pay to atone for a certain complexity of mind.
A high degree of loneliness is an inexorable part of being a sensitive and intelligent human. It’s a built-in feature of a complex existence.
If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together.
Loneliness is a sign you are in desperate need of yourself.
Loneliness is cured by contact with yourself.
Boredom is a defense mechanism to avoid having to sit alone with our unaddressed thoughts.
If you can only learn from people that you 100% agree with on everything, it’s going to be a dark and lonely life.
In the long run, every pain is a gift.
It is the barren silence of winter that makes the birdsong and blossoms of spring so enchanting. Leisure after labor. Company after solitude. Home after a voyage. Contrasts reveal the nature of things. The world is always in flux. Appreciate the season while it lasts.
Part 1. The wisdom of our language has grasped these two sides of a man’s being alone. It has created the word loneliness in order to emphasize the pain of being alone, and it has created the word solitude in order to emphasize the glory of being alone. In daily life, these words are not always distinguished; but we should do it consistently, thus deepening by these very words the understanding of our human predicament.
Part 2. Loneliness can be conquered alone by those who can bear solitude. Let us dare to have solitude — to face the eternal, to find others, to see ourselves. 
Alternate between the solitary and the social. Whether alone or with others, keep serenity.
The best way to get approval is not to need it.
Part 1. Modern society gives us incredible flexibility in that we can get away from our crazy family members, and we’re not destined to die where we were born or do what our parents did. So we have incredible freedom.
Part 2. But then coming with it is this tremendous loneliness that we try and cover up either through drugs or alcohol, or partying, even trying to find a mission like putting people on Mars. But the reality is a lot of that loneliness just comes from being disconnected from growing up with your tribal environment.
The only way to survive is to admit you are on your own, learn to make your own decisions, and trust your judgement.
When you’re alone, watch your thoughts. When you’re successful, watch your ego. When you’ve got problems, watch your emotions. When you’re with the crowds, watch what you say.
You have your way. I have my way. As for the right way, the correct way, and the only way, it does not exist.
What is needed is this, and this alone: solitude, great inner loneliness. Going into oneself and not meeting anyone for hours – that is what one must arrive at.
It is good to be solitary, for solitude is difficult; that something is difficult must be a reason the more for us to do it.
The whole conviction of my life now rests upon the belief that loneliness, far from being a rare and curious phenomenon, peculiar to myself and to a few other solitary men, is the central and inevitable fact of human existence. When we examine the moments, acts, and statements of all kinds of people — not only the grief and ecstasy of the greatest poets, but also the huge unhappiness of the average soul…we find, I think, that they are all suffering from the same thing. The final cause of their complaint is loneliness.
Love is the only sane and satisfactory answer to the problem of human existence.

Tears come from the heart and not from the brain.
What brings us to tears, will lead us to grace. Our pain is never wasted.
Life is made of so many partings welded together.
Sometimes it takes sadness to know happiness, noise to appreciate silence and absence to value presence.
When you’re happy you enjoy the music, but when you’re sad you understand the lyrics.
Every man has his secret sorrows which the world knows not; and often times we call a man cold when he is only sad.
If you didn’t remember something happening, was it because it never had happened? Or because you wished it hadn’t?
The good life is not one immune to sadness but one in which suffering contributes to our development.
It’s sad when someone you know becomes someone you knew.
Ninety-nine percent of your problems are created by you because you take life seriously.
Nothing changes if nothing changes.
Your sadness is a gift. Don’t reject it. Don’t rush it. Live it fully and use it as fuel to change and grow.
Don’t grieve. Anything you lose comes round in another form.
Don’t desire happiness because it creates only unhappiness and nothing else.
Tears are far more beautiful than anything that you have with you, because tears come from the overflow of your being.
It was a fine cry – loud and long – but it had no bottom and it had no top, just circles and circles of sorrow.
Crying is all right in its way while it lasts. But you have to stop sooner or later, and then you still have to decide what to do.
Perhaps I know best why it is man alone who laughs; he alone suffers so deeply that he had to invent laughter.
How to be unhappy: stay inside all day, move as little as possible, spend more than you earn, take yourself (and life) too seriously, look for reasons why things won’t work, always consume, never contribute, resent the lucky and successful, never say hello first, be unreliable.
Friendship = vulnerability * time. If loneliness is epidemic, this seems like an important part of the fix.
If you eat, invest, and think according to what the ‘news’ advocates, you’ll end up nutritionally, financially and morally bankrupt.
The perfected future never arrives. Life is full of seemingly endless trouble, and then life ends. Find peace in the imperfect present.
Feeling lost, crazy and desperate belongs to a good life as much as optimism, certainty and reason.
Perhaps, somewhere, some day, at a less miserable time, we may see each other again.
You don’t need water to feel like you’re drowning, do you?
Life seems but a quick succession of busy nothings.
Love is not a victory march. It’s a cold and it’s a broken hallelujah.
Never be afraid of tears. Tear-filled eyes are capable of seeing truth. Tear-filled eyes are capable of seeing the beauty of life.
There are two medicines for all ills: time and silence.
For even as love crowns you so shall he crucify you.
Blaming other people for things that are going wrong guarantees your continued misery.
Tears are words the heart can’t express.
Heaven knows we need never be ashamed of our tears, for they are rain upon the blinding dust of earth, overlying our hard hearts. I was better after I had cried, than before – more sorry, more aware of my own ingratitude, more gentle.
Even a happy life cannot be without a measure of darkness, and the word happy would lose its meaning if it were not balanced by sadness. It is far better to take things as they come along with patience and equanimity.
The opposite of love is indifference.
Chasing happiness is guaranteed to make to you unhappy.
When you lose, do not lose the lesson.
I always like walking in the rain, so no one can see me crying.
All man’s miseries stem from his inability to sit quietly in a room and do nothing.
Proud people breed sad sorrows for themselves.
Behind every sweet smile, there is a bitter sadness that no one can ever see and feel.
When you feel like you’ve had it up to here, and you’re mad enough to scream, but you’re sad enough to tear, that’s rock bottom.
Many people are alive but don’t touch the miracle of being alive.
One thing you can’t hide — is when you’re crippled inside.
The funniest people are the saddest ones.
The sadness will last forever.
Sadness flies away on the wings of time.
I used to think the worst thing in life was to end up all alone, it’s not. The worst thing in life is to end up with people who make you feel alone.
People cry, not because they’re weak. It’s because they’ve been strong for too long.
Parting is such sweet sorrow that I shall say goodnight till it be morrow.
When you do something noble and beautiful and nobody noticed, do not be sad. For the sun every morning is a beautiful spectacle and yet most of the audience still sleeps.
Some people care too much. I think it’s called love.
Turn your wounds into wisdom.
Those who do not weep, do not see.
Lord help my poor soul.
Trifles make the sum of life.
We forge the chains we wear in life.
Every heart has its own skeletons.
I am just another dot in the world.
Unhappy people focus on what’s missing.
Saying nothing sometimes says the most.
The trouble is, you think you have time. 
In the valley of sorrow, spread your wings. 
You’re sad because you’re afraid of reality.
It’s much easier not to know things sometimes.
This moment will just be another story someday.
I am nobody! Who are you? Are you a nobody, too?
A long life makes acquaintance with a thousand ills.
There is prodigious strength in sorrow and despair.
No one is really going to help you or give you direction. In fact, the odds are against you.
You’re sad because you’re wasting your potential. You know it, your family knows it, everyone knows it. Do something useful.
Nothing sadder than seeing a person settle for so much lower than their potential.
That is my work, to transform your life from a sad affair into a celebration.
Sadness is silent, it is yours. It is coming because you are alone. It is giving you a chance to go deeper into your aloneness. Rather than jumping from one shallow happiness to another shallow happiness and wasting your life, it is better to use sadness as a means for meditation. Witness it. It is a friend! It opens the door of your eternal aloneness.
Life needs both: thorns and roses, days and nights, happiness/unhappiness, birth/death. Be a witness to it all and you will know something that is beyond birth, beyond death; something that is beyond darkness and beyond light; something that is beyond happiness, beyond unhappiness.
I’ve learned more from pain than I could’ve ever learned from pleasure.
The human condition is a good one in that no one is unhappy except by his own fault.
You say: “I did not think it would happen”. Do you think there is anything that will not happen, when you know that it is possible to happen, when you see that it has already happened to many?
I have seen great beauty of spirit in some who were great sufferers […] and I have seen the last illness produce treasures of fortitude and meekness from most unpromising subjects.
Its good to leave each day behind, like flowing water, free of sadness. Yesterday is gone and its tale told. Today new seeds are growing.
Experiencing sadness and anger can make you feel more creative, and by being creative, you can get beyond your pain or negativity.
This genuine heart of sadness can teach us great compassion. It can humble us when we’re arrogant and soften us when we are unkind.
Usually when people are sad, they don’t do anything. They just cry over their condition. But when they get angry, they bring about a change.
Man performs and engenders so much more than he can or should have to bear. That’s how he finds that he can bear anything.
Let there be sunshine, let there be rain, let the broken hearted love again.
There is not enough darkness in all the world to put out the light of even one small candle.
Be patient where you sit in the dark. The dawn is coming.
The wound is the place where the light enters you.
Where there is ruin, there is hope for a treasure.
People have said, “Don’t cry” to other people for years and years, and all it has ever meant is, “I’m too uncomfortable when you show your feelings. Don’t cry”. I’d rather have them say, “Go ahead and cry. I’m here to be with you.”
If you’re feeling sad, remember soon you’ll forget and move on with life. Your grief is transitory. If you’re going to let go anyway, why not do so immediately? If you don’t cling to your grief you won’t suffer. Life is a river, flow with it. Don’t hold onto anything. Let go.
Feeling down, lost, confused, angry, jealous are all parts of the human condition. Don’t fight them. Understand them. Accept them. Love them and go beyond them.
If you’re sad, it’s okay to acknowledge your sadness. If you have pain that leaves you at a loss, it’s okay to talk about it. The reason we have difficulties is that we’re unable to accept the things that can’t be changed. Let them be and see what happens.
Clouds release their sadness by crying until they can cry no more. When they have no tears left, they feel a great weight has been lifted, as heavy as the tears they’ve shed. We can release our sadness into the sky within us. When we feel sad, it’s okay to cry like the clouds.
Listen. Really, really listen if someone opens up to you about their mental health. A response isn’t always needed, but a compassionate ear is.
Most people think that if they move somewhere else and change their environment, everything will change. Usually they end up re-creating the same results they had elsewhere. If you want to change your world, change your beliefs.
The cure for anything is salt water – sweat, tears, or the sea.
Whenever sorrow comes, be kind to it. For God has placed a pearl in sorrow’s hand.
Sorrow prepares you for joy. It violently sweeps everything out of your house, so that new joy can find space to enter. It shakes the yellow leaves from the bough of your heart, so that fresh, green leaves can grow in their place.
Don’t get lost in your pain, know that one day your pain will become your cure.
In the presence of nature, a wild delight runs through the man, in spite of real sorrows.
Do not be sad about what you do not have. Instead, be happy about what you do have. If you will be sad about what you don’t have, you will not be happy about what you do have.
“Be grateful to everyone” means that all situations teach you, and often it’s the tough ones that teach you best.
It’s just hard to see a friend hurt this much. Especially when you can’t do anything except ‘be there.’ I just want to make him stop hurting, but I can’t. So I just follow him around whenever he wants to show me his world.
It’s nice to have things to look forward to!
Keep busy at something: a busy person never has time to be unhappy.
We must embrace pain and burn it as fuel for our journey.
Pain is inevitable. Suffering is optional.
Suffering is a gift; in its hidden mercy.
What need is there to weep over parts of life? The whole of it calls for tears.
I was weeping again, drunk on the impossible past.
Some people seemed to get all sunshine, and some all shadow.
You will become way less concerned with what other people think of you when you realize how seldom they do.
The most difficult battles that you will fight in your life is that between your mind who knows the truth and your heart that refuse to accept it.
It is easier to be miserable because the whole crowd is miserable. It feels more comfortable to be with the crowd than to be alone.
Modern society tends to emphasize buoyancy and cheerfulness but we have to admit that reality is, for the most part, about grief and loss.
Most of our life is a battle, a strain, the anxiety, the guilt, the despair, the immense sense of loneliness and sorrow, that is our life. That is actually what is and we are unwilling to face it.
We are at war with ourselves, unhappy, dissatisfied, seeking something which we don’t know, violent, aggressive, corrupt, astonishingly miserable and lonely and suffering a great deal. Somehow we don’t seem to be able to get out of this, to be free of these conditionings. 
The worst kind of sad is not being able to explain why.
But now the joy is gone and the sadness is back, the sadness feels like something deserved, the price of some not-quite-forgotten betrayal.
Today we are afraid of simple words like goodness and mercy and kindness. We don’t believe in the good old words because we don’t believe in good old values anymore. And that’s why the world is sick.
The more you consume, the sadder you get. The sadder you get, the more you consume.
I have no faith in human perfectibility. I think that human exertion will have no appreciable effect upon humanity. Man is now only more active – not more happy – nor more wise, than he was 6000 years ago.
In every parting there is an image of death.
We think sometimes that poverty is only being hungry, naked and homeless. The poverty of being unwanted, unloved and uncared for is the greatest poverty.
Don’t worry about me. Go and enjoy yourself. I’ll stay here and be miserable.
Bad things happen and you can’t do anything about it.
It’s ok to be sad after making the right decision.
Misery comes the moment you become clinging, attached. The moment you put conditions on life.
Everybody wants to destroy misery, but everybody goes on desiring, and by desiring one goes on creating more and more misery.
Happiness is one pole, sadness is another. Blissfulness is one pole, misery is another. Life consists of both, and life is richer because of both. A life only of blissfulness will have extension, but will not have depth. A life of only sadness will have depth, but will not have extension.
The more secrets you have, the less happy you’re going to be.
The fundamental delusion – there is something out there that will make me happy and fulfilled forever.
At the heart of every frustration lies a basic structure: the collision of a wish with an unyielding reality.
He soon felt that the fulfillment of his desires gave him only one grain of the mountain of happiness he had expected. This fulfillment showed him the eternal error men make in imagining that their happiness depends on the realization of their desires.
To be more comfortable with yourself, improve your self-knowledge. To improve your self-knowledge, meditate.
Sadness is a force of great depth and breadth. Too much sadness leads us to be passive, depressive, self-pitying and incapable of action. Too little leads us to be superficial, indifferent, repressing and lacking in sensitivity.
Rejecting the moment creates friction. Friction creates confusion. Confusion creates sadness. 
Accept – then act. Whatever the present moment contains, accept it as if you had chosen it. Always work with it, not against it. Make it your friend and ally, not your enemy. This will miraculously transform your whole life.
Sorrow is an inextricable part of life. Whoever lives experiences it. There’s no escape. If we understand this then we would stop bewailing every misfortune that occurs. Life is a bargain. You want joy but you can’t have it without suffering. You must accept the whole package.
Impermanence of everything is a universal constant. No matter what kind of legacy, family, foundation, or business you’ve created, one day it will disappear and no one will remember anything of your life.
Boredom, anger, sadness, or fear are not ‘yours,’ not personal. They are conditions of the human mind. They come and go. Nothing that comes and goes is you.
Most of the trouble in life comes from misunderstanding.
Mostly it is loss which teaches us about the worth of things.
What if the worst thing that happened to you turns out to be the best thing that has ever happened to you?
