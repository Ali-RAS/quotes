First principle: one must need strength, otherwise one will never have it.
Who is strong? He that can conquer his bad habits.
He that can compose himself, is wiser than he that composes books.
In matters of style, swim with the current; in matters of principle, stand like a rock.
Never give up on what you really want to do. The person with big dreams is more powerful than one with all the facts.
Just like in bodybuilding, failure is also a necessary experience for growth in our own lives, for if we’re never tested to our limits, how will we know how strong we really are? How will we ever grow?
It takes more strength to repair than to build, to start anew than to begin, to be reconciled than to get along.

Be more than motivated, be more than driven, become literally obsessed to the point where people think you’re f*cking nuts. David Goggins
This life is all a f*cking mind game. Realize that. Own it!
You must be courageous to admit that all things are possible, and that you are equipped to handle them all.
Courage is more exhilarating than fear and in the long run it is easier. We do not have to become heroes overnight. Just a step at a time, meeting each thing that comes up, seeing it is not as dreadful as it appeared, discovering we have the strength to stare it down.
You are only free when you realize you belong no place – you belong every place – no place at all. The price is high. The reward is great.
The most spiritual men, as the strongest, find their happiness where others would find their destruction: in the labyrinth, in hardness against themselves and others, in experiments. Their joy is self-conquest: asceticism becomes in them nature, need, and instinct. Difficult tasks are a privilege to them; to play with burdens that crush others, a recreation. Knowledge – a form of asceticism. They are the most venerable kind of man: that does not preclude their being the most cheerful and the kindliest.
All the happiness in the world, all the good fortune on earth, compares not to a mind that has come upon silence.
You’re braver than you believe, and stronger than you seem, and smarter than you think.
What makes you beautiful is your presence. What makes you wise is your perseverance.

It’s when our back is against the wall that we most often find a new door.
Your brain is the most powerful weapon in the world.
Life is hard and unfair. That’s why you must get up one more time. That’s why you must keep going no matter what.
While it’s admirable to have a strong personality that’s consistent for all, one who can’t adjust to the moment is at a serious disadvantage.
Meeting smaller emergencies and learning to deal with them had given me the confidence to deal with this larger emergency. So, little by little, I found out how to do things. After each catastrophe you don’t worry so much the next time, and each time you emerge stronger from your victory.

Take the long view. This is going to be a nine-inning game. There will be highs and lows. Focus on what you can control.

The world caters to the unserious. The serious must cater to themselves.
The world is too big and too busy to care about you. This is a blessing, for it makes you free.
If you are easily provoked you are easily controlled.
I say, drop all your defences. Anyone can make a mistake — even you. Do not defend your mistakes; just accept them and move on. When you are totally defenceless, that is when you will be completely strong.
No one thinks about you in quite the way you think. No one will love you in the way that you hope. No one can give you what you have always longed for. No one will make you what you seek to become. To lean is to fall.
It’s impossible to improve yourself when you see yourself as a victim in every situation.
There is nobody who is going to solve any of our problems, either political, religious or psychological.

If we are not ashamed to think it, we should not be ashamed to say it.
Your good fortune is not to need good fortune. (On Providence)
Anything which is troubling you, anything which is irritating you, that is your teacher.
It is preposterous to take to heart that which you should throw over your shoulders.
Buddha’s doctrine: man suffers because of his craving to possess and keep forever things which are impermanent.
You aren’t mature enough to debate something if you can’t accept the possibility of being wrong.
The weak focus on appearing strong and smart. The wise ignore others and find solutions.
How unlucky I am that this should happen to me. But not at all. Perhaps, say how lucky I am that I am not broken by what has happened, and I am not afraid of what is about to happen.
Nature builds things that are antifragile. In the case of evolution, nature uses disorder to grow stronger. Occasional starvation or going to the gym also makes you stronger, because you subject your body to stressors and gain from them.
We must gain victory, not by assaulting the walls, but by accepting them. Only when this surrender is made can we assure ourselves of inward quietness, and locate the next step on the road to ultimate victory.
Whoever then wishes to be free, let him neither wish for anything nor avoid anything which depends on others: if he does not observe this rule, he must be a slave.
But what is philosophy? Doesn’t it simply mean preparing ourselves for what may come? Don’t you understand that really amounts to saying that if I would so prepare myself to endure, then let anything happen that will? Otherwise, it would be like the boxer exiting the ring because he took some punches. Actually, you can leave the boxing ring without consequence, but what advantage would come from abandoning the pursuit of wisdom? So, what should each of us say to every trial we face? This is what I’ve trained for, for this my discipline!
Amateurs believe that the world should work the way they want it to. Professionals realize that they have to work with the world as they find it.
When you see yourself as a witness, separate from ego, then no person or situation can shake you.
Failure-resistant is achievable; failure-free is not.
Do not let the body be dragged along by mind nor be dragged along by the body.
Do what you can, with what you have, where you are.
No one can make you feel inferior without your consent.
When I was a boy I used to think that strong meant having big muscles, great physical power; but the longer I live, the more I realize that real strength has much more to do with what is not seen. Real strength has to do with helping others.
Why fit in when you were born to stand out?
I wonder if we confuse strength and other words – like aggression and even violence. Real strength is neither male nor female; but is, quite simply, one of the finest characteristics that any human being can possess.
Life is a blend of sensitivity and sensibility. Sensibility is intellect, sensitivity is of the heart. You need to be sensitive yet strong.
Conquer yourself rather than the world.
When you over value compliments you become vulnerable to insults and judgement.
When one has not had a good father, one must create one.
Think of the life you have lived until now as over and, as a dead man, see what’s left as a bonus and live it according to Nature. Love the hand that fate deals you and play it as your own, for what could be more fitting?
I’ve decided to make myself strong. As far as I can tell, that’s all I can do.
No matter what they say, no matter what they think, do the right thing.
People are capable, at any time in their lives, of doing what they dream of.
You must do the thing you think you cannot do.
Fire is the test of gold; adversity, of strong men.
The art of life is not controlling what happens to us, but using what happens to us.
Don’t go to the doctor with every distemper, nor to the lawyer with every quarrel, nor to the pot for every thirst.
All that happens to us, including our humiliations, our misfortunes, our embarrassments, all is given to us as raw material, as clay, so that we may shape our art.
So other people hurt me? That’s their problem. Their character and actions are not mine.
Either you reach a higher point today, or you exercise your strength in order to be able to climb higher tomorrow.
To try to avoid pain is to give too many f*cks about pain. In contrast, if you’re able to not give a f*ck about pain, you become unstoppable.
Comfort is the craving that can take away your life. Develop the power to resist it, and you become unstoppable.
Mankind has never achieved greatness but through suffering.
There is no security for those who seek it outside of themselves.

Be persevering at the bottom, humble at the top.
We can do anything we want to do if we stick to it long enough.
Success comes from curiosity, concentration, perseverance and self-criticism.
There is no armor like perseverance.
Perseverance is the hard work you do after you get tired of doing the hard work you already did.
He who has a why to live can bear with almost any how.
There’s no talent here. This is hard work. This is obsession. Talent does not exist.
If it’s endurable, then endure it. Stop complaining.
The extent of the struggle determines the extent of the growth. The obstacle is an advantage, not adversity. The enemy is any perception that prevents us from seeing this.
The less pain we tolerate, the more average we become.
Impatience with actions, patience with results.
The world makes way for the man who knows where he is going.
The further the reward from the effort, the thinner the competition. Patience is the gatekeeper.
Never stop just because you feel defeated. The journey to the other side is attainable only after great suffering.
The people who stick with things for years and never stop almost always win the race.

No conqueror believes in chance.

Three tips for becoming successful: consistency, consistency, and consistency.
The most important thing is to keep going. The second most important thing is to choose the right direction.
You may encounter many defeats, but you must not be defeated. In fact, it may be necessary to encounter the defeats, so you can know who you are, what you can rise from, how you can still come out of it.
Nothing in this world can take the place of persistence. Talent will not; nothing is more common than unsuccessful men with talent. Genius will not; unrewarded genius is almost a proverb. Education will not; the world is full of educated derelicts. Persistence and determination alone are omnipotent. The slogan Press On! has solved and always will solve the problems of the human race.
Progress means getting nearer to the place you want to be. And if you have taken a wrong turn, then to go forward does not get you any nearer.
I was taught the way of progress is neither swift nor easy.
There is no downside to endurance. If you can endure more, you can do more.
Character consists of what you do on the third and fourth tries.
You have to practice even, maybe especially, when it hurts.

Let me tell you the secret that has led to my goal. My strength lies solely in my tenacity.
In the realm of ideas everything depends on enthusiasm… in the real world all rests on perseverance.
You don’t need to build confidence to achieve challenging goals. You build confidence through achieving challenging goals. Confidence is more the result of progress than the cause of it.
Amateurs give up at the first sign of trouble and assume they’re failures. Professionals see failure as part of the path to growth and mastery.
Perhaps happiness is always to be found in the journey uphill, and not in the fleeting sense of satisfaction awaiting at the next peak.
If you can just maintain that consistent energy in one direction, it’s incredible what you could deflect over a long period of time.
Great ones are willing to get burned time and again as they sharpen their swords in the fire.
One of the most astonishing human traits: our ability to keeping getting up, lugging ourselves around and doing our stuff day after day.
Your 1st blog post will be bad, but your 1000th will be great. Your 1st workout will be weak, but your 1000th will be strong. Your 1st meditation will be scattered, but your 1000th will be focused. Put in your reps.
Whoever says you can’t develop mental toughness or anything else doesn’t truly understand the human mind or the human spirit.
Have a sense of urgency and commitment – what you do you must do well, with all of your energy, not with a mind shooting off in a hundred direction.
Man matures when he no longer believes discomfort is uncomfortable.
Through perseverance many people win success out of what seemed destined to be certain failure.
Ask, ‘Why is this so unbearable? Why can’t I endure it?’ You’ll be embarrassed to answer.
If there is no struggle, there is no progress.
Never, never, never, never give up.
Some people want it to happen, some wish it would happen, and others make it happen.
Never give up on what you really want to do. The person with big dreams is more powerful than one with all the facts.
It’s not that I’m so smart, it’s just that I stay with problems longer.
If you dare nothing, then when the day is over, nothing is all you will have gained.
Adversity is always the partner of progress.
I’d rather attempt to do something great and fail than to attempt to do nothing and succeed.

The magnitude of a progress is gauged by the greatness of the sacrifice that it requires.

Perseverance, secret of all triumphs.
Stand firm, and you will win life.
And let us not grow weary of doing good, for in due season we will reap, if we do not give up.
Success seems to be connected with action. Successful men keep moving. They make mistakes, but they don’t quit.
Don’t get upset when people don’t support your dreams, those same folk aren’t supporting their own dreams.
If you really want to be great at something, you have to truly care about it. If you want to be great in a particular area, you have to obsess over it. A lot of people say they want to be great, but they’re not willing to make the sacrifices necessary to achieve greatness. They have other concerns, whether important or not, and they spread themselves out. That’s totally fine. After all, greatness is not for everybody.
One day, the people that didn’t believe in you will tell everyone how they met you.
I did not succeed in life by intelligence. I succeeded because I have a long attention span.
Everybody has a plan until they get punched in the mouth.

There is no substitute for determination, perseverance, and planning.
You are the person you have been waiting for.
The great end of life is not knowledge but action.
It’s not what we do once in a while that shapes our lives. It’s what we do consistently.
You’re a winner if you keep your head up. You’re a warrior if you keep fighting forever.
The secret to genius is not genetics but daily practice married with relentless perseverance.
Let me not pray to be sheltered from dangers, but to be fearless in facing them. Let me not beg for the stilling of my pain, but for the heart to conquer it.
Before you dream about the view from the summit, ask yourself if you’re willing to keep your head down, focus on the path, and spend your life walking up the side of a very big hill. It takes years of walking to earn a minute at the top.
Blessed is the one who perseveres under trial because, having stood the test, that person will receive the crown of life.
We are afflicted in every way, but not crushed; perplexed, but not driven to despair; persecuted, but not forsaken; struck down, but not destroyed.
Show up. Show up when it’s hard. Show up when you’re scared. Just keep showing up. Show them your truth. Do it by showing up and not backing down.
The key to success isn’t studying. The key to success isn’t being rich or coming from a good family or having the right education. The key to success is putting one foot in front of the other, even when you’re scared out of your mind. The key to success is never f*cking giving up.
When you think that you are done, you’re only 40% in to what your body’s capable of doing. That’s just the limits that we put on ourselves.
A savage mindset is a conditioned mindset that knows quitting is not part of the plan. It knows that it has to find a way around any and all obstacles to complete the mission.
Failure is often that early morning hour of darkness which precedes the dawning of the day of success.
A lot of successful people who say “work smart, not hard” worked like dogs to get established.
If you’re willing to bleed a little every day, you may win big later.
You will receive most when you will expect least.
It does not matter how slowly you go as long as you do not stop.
I don’t have talent, so I just get up earlier.
A crowbar is a universal pass key.
Every strike brings me closer to the next home run.
That’s one of the remarkable things about life. It’s never so bad that it can’t get worse.
Even in the mud and scum of things, something always, always sings.
I am extraordinarily patient, provided I get my own way in the end.
I am a slow walker, but I never walk back.
You don’t get to choose not to pay a price, you only get to choose which price you pay.
Once you learn to quit, it becomes a habit.
If you believe talent exists, you’re limiting yourself. If you believe luck exists, you’re lazy. If you believe in yourself, you’re wise.
Superhuman effort…isn’t worth a damn unless it achieves results.
Obstinacy is the result of the will forcing itself into the place of the intellect.
Luck can be created. Build your character until luck becomes your destiny.
Somebody out there thinks you’re an idiot. Somebody out there thinks you’re brilliant. Ignore them both and carry on.
Being a founder is hard. Being an early employee is hard. Being a VC is hard. Being a politician is hard. Being an engineer is hard. Being a writer is hard. Being a friend is hard. Being a partner is hard. Being a parent is hard. It’s all hard. Life is hard, and then you die.
You can’t guarantee your success, but you can guarantee your failure. Don’t give up, and you cannot fail.
When I reach the place of my dreams, I will thank my failures and tears. They too, kept me going.
Routine, repetition, tedium, monotony, ephemeracy, inconsequence, abstraction, disorder, boredom, angst, ennui – these are the true hero’s enemies, and make no mistake, they are fearsome indeed. For they are real.
Perseverance is not a long race; it is many short races one after another.
Everyone wants some magic pill – some life hack – that eliminates the need to do the work. But that does not exist.
You don’t need an easier life, but rather an attitude of perseverance. Attitude precedes outcome.
For water continually dropping will wear hard rocks hollow.
A bend in the road is not the end of the road… Unless you fail to make the turn.
If you don’t know yourself, you don’t know what you love. If you don’t know what you love, you can’t persevere.
It’s hard to prioritize the long term when you think you should feel comfortable in every moment.
Error is inevitable. Persisting in it is not.
Bad persistence: Endlessly doing the same thing with no success. Good persistence: Continuously tweaking your approach until you get results.
Hard lessons are hard to forget. Let hardship be a source of knowledge, not bitterness. Wisdom is hard-won.
The most useful form of patience is persistence. Patience implies waiting for things to improve on their own. Persistence implies keeping your head down and continuing to work when things take longer than you expect.
You might be winning but you’re not growing, and growing might be the most important form of winning.
If you are on the wrong road, progress means doing an about-turn and walking back to the right road; and in that case the man who turns back soonest is the most progressive man.
You don’t control the outcome. You control the quality of effort you put in. That’s what you should hold yourself accountable for.
If you’re focused on the outcome, you’re not focused on the process. Sustain success over long periods comes from a fanatical focus on process. You don’t need to be perfect, just better than yesterday.
Learn to maintain your objectivity, especially when it’s hardest.
We must undergo a hard winter training and not rush into things for which we haven’t prepared.
It is not enough that we do our best; sometimes we must do what is required.
The brick walls are there for a reason. The brick walls are not there to keep us out. The brick walls are there to give us a chance to show how badly we want something. Because the brick walls are there to stop the people who don’t want it badly enough. They’re there to stop the other people.

The pessimist sees difficulty in every opportunity. The optimist sees the opportunity in every difficulty.

Never let your head hang down. Never give up and sit down and grieve. Find another way. And don’t pray when it rains if you don’t pray when the sun shines.
The future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams.
If you don’t like something change it. If you can’t change it, change your attitude about it. Don’t complain.
Believe that life is worth living and your belief will help create the fact.
If opportunity doesn’t knock, build a door.
The secret is contained in a three-part formula I learned in the gym: self-confidence, a positive mental attitude, and honest hard work.
Our greatest weakness lies in giving up. The most certain way to succeed is always to try just one more time.
There is a sense that things, if you keep positive and optimistic about what can be done, do work out.

It took me quite a long time to develop a voice, and now that I have it, I am not going to be silent.

Sometimes the bad things that happen in our lives put us directly on the path to the best things that will ever happen to us.
